    "content": "H1: Trading\nTrading is a gameplay mechanic that allows players to exchange emeralds for items , and vice versa, with villagers and wandering traders .\nH2: Mechanics\nPressing use on an adult villager with a profession, or on a wandering trader , opens a menu, allowing a player to trade with that merchant. This action pauses any pathfinding the merchant was doing and makes it face you. If the merchant takes damage while trading, the trading menu closes. The same thing happens if they walk or are transported far enough away.\nAll transactions involve emeralds . Trading is the only method of acquiring the globe banner pattern , woodland explorer map , trial explorer map , and ocean explorer map in Survival mode. It is also the only renewable way to obtain bells , diamond gear, [ note 1 ] lapis lazuli ‌ [ BE only ] , bottles o' enchanting , glass , sand , red sand , coral blocks , arrow of decay ,‌ [ BE only ] and small dripleaves .\nH3: Level\nVillagers have five career levels that can be increased by trading with them. Each villager starts at the novice level. A villager's level can be seen in the trading menu. The badge that a villager wears can also be identified: stone for a novice, iron for an apprentice, gold for a journeyman, emerald for an expert, and diamond for a master. Trading until the villager's trading bar gets full unlocks the next level of trades. When a player trades with a villager, both the villager and the player gain experience . All villager trades reward the player with 3–6 experience plus an additional 5 experience if the villager levels up with the trade. Trading with a wandering trader also rewards the player with some experience, although the trader does not have experience levels to gain. A villager levels up when its experience bar becomes full and gains up to two‌ [ JE only ] or three‌ [ BE only ] new trades and retains its existing trades. Additionally, a villager receives a Regeneration effect and becomes surrounded by purple particles for ten seconds.\nTrades from the master level would still reward the villager with experience, but it has no actual effect as the villager can't level up any further.\nEach badge is 2x3 pixels except the novice (stone) badge, which is 4x4 pixels.\n\nTABLE:\nLevel | Badge | Name | Total villager experience required\n1 | Novice | 0\n2 | Apprentice | 10\n3 | Journeyman | 70\n4 | Expert | 150\n5 | Master | 250\n\nIn Java Edition , villagers have a maximum of 10 trades. Each level unlocks a maximum of two new trades. If a level has a pool of more than two trades, the two offered trades are chosen randomly from the set.\nIn Bedrock Edition , villagers have 7–10 trade slots. A slot with multiple possible trades will display only one trade; for example, farmer villagers have 4 potential trades in their first trade slot, so each trade has a 1 ⁄ 4 chance to be chosen. [ until Villager Trade Rebalancing ] [ verify ]\nA villager's profession dictates the trading pool used to determine its trades. For example, villagers wearing straw hats are farmers, so their trades are based on the Farmer trade pool. Each profession unlocks a predefined and finite set of offers. Different professions are assigned to each villager based on their job-site block. This profession is indicated by their appearance and in the trading interface. Novice villagers who have not traded can lose their profession and change back into unemployed villagers if their claimed job site block is removed. Removing and then replacing a job site block can alter the trades offered, and a villager with no experience resets its trades every so often. Once a player trades with a villager, the villager keeps its profession forever and subsequently locks in the offered trades.\nH3: Trades\nEach trade can be used a maximum number of times, after which the villager runs out of stock and trade becomes disabled. The exact number is different for each item and referenced in the tables below. When villagers work at their job site blocks , they activate their offers again, up to twice per day. In Bedrock Edition , villagers need to be linked to a bed to restock their trades (it is not necessary for them to sleep, but require a bed nearby). When an offer is disabled, a red \"X\" appears in the trading interface in Java Edition , or the trading slot becomes red in Bedrock Edition , and the villager displays the same particle effect as an offer being created.\nWhen buying items from players, villagers ignore additional item data ; this allows, for example, selling renamed or enchanted items, as well as lodestone compasses instead of regular compasses in Java Edition . When the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment is enabled, taiga armorers can also accept damaged armor.\nH3: Sale prices\nThe price of an item rises and falls depending on three factors. Items with a high price multiplier (0.2) are affected by these changes more than items with a low multiplier (0.05). All price fluctuations affect only the first item involved in trade; for example, for an initial trade of 32 sticks for 1 emerald, the price might be driven down to 1 stick or up to 64 sticks for 1 emerald, but never for 2 emeralds. Additionally, no quantity can go lower than 1 or higher than the stack size.\nThe first factor is demand. An item that was sold out gets a price increase for all players when resupplied. If a player does not trade for a higher-priced item, the price is reduced the next time the villager resupplies. Demand is tracked per item, not per villager , so a villager can offer a higher-priced trade for a single item while other items are cheaper. Trades that have a price multiplier of 0 are not affected by demand.\nThe second way to affect prices is the Hero of the Village effect, gained from successfully completing a raid, which temporarily reduces prices for the affected player depending on the level of the effect.\nFinally, players get personal discounts or penalties‌ [ Java Edition only ] based on their reputation with a particular villager. A positive reputation is gained by curing zombie villagers (the cured villager gives a much larger permanent discount than the temporary discount given by nearby villagers). Giving a zombie villager the Weakness effect and then feeding it a golden apple starts the curing process. After five minutes, it transforms into a villager. The permanent discount is capped at one cure, while the temporary discount is capped at eight cures [ needs testing ] . Players can also gain negative reputation by hitting or killing villagers, and positive reputation by trading. In Bedrock Edition , negative reputation can reduce or eliminate discounts but does not result in penalties.\nH2: Non-trading villagers\nIf the player attempts to trade with a non-trading villager in Java Edition , it grunts and bobs its head, but if the player tries to do the same thing in Bedrock Edition , nothing happens.\nH3: Nitwit\nNitwits are green-coated villagers. They cannot gain a profession.\nWhile they can be used for breeding, it is not possible to get a baby nitwit by breeding adult nitwits.\nH3: Unemployed villager\nVillagers without a job cannot trade. They only wear their biome outfits. An unemployed villager gains a profession by claiming an unclaimed job site block . For example, an unclaimed cartography table converts an unemployed villager into a cartographer when the villager claims it, and both the villager and the table emit green particles. An inaccessible (or destroyed) job site block causes the connected villager to lose its profession, but that does not affect the player's popularity in the village.\nH3: Baby villagers\nThe appearance of baby villagers is the same as that of the corresponding adult unemployed villagers, but their bodies are smaller. They can't get a job and trade.\nH2: Trade offers\nThe villager pictured on the right is from the plains biome. To see villager professions dressed for other biomes, see Villagers § Professions .\nIn Java Edition , starting from Novice, at each level two additional trades become available, unless there is only one trade within that level. If there are more than two possible trades, two are randomly selected.\nIn Bedrock Edition , one trade is chosen randomly from each slot available. For example, if there are two items on the same slot, then only one of them will show up in the trade.\nH3: Armorer\nJob site block: Blast Furnace\n\nTABLE:\nArmorer\nLevel | Bedrock Edition | Java Edition | Item wanted | Item given | Trades instock | Price multiplier | Villager XP\nSlot | Probability | Probability\nNovice | 1 | 100% | 40% | 15 ×Coal | Emerald | 16 | 0.05 | 2\n2 | 25% | 40% | 5 ×Emerald | Iron Helmet | 12 | 0.2 | 1\n25% | 40% | 9 ×Emerald | Iron Chestplate | 12 | 0.2 | 1\n25% | 40% | 7 ×Emerald | Iron Leggings | 12 | 0.2 | 1\n25% | 40% | 4 ×Emerald | Iron Boots | 12 | 0.2 | 1\nApprentice | 3 | 100% | 50% | 4 ×Iron Ingot | Emerald | 12 | 0.05 | 10\n4 | 33% | 50% | 36 ×Emerald | Bell | 12 | 0.2 | 5\n33% | 50% | 3 ×Emerald | Chainmail Leggings | 12 | 0.2 | 5\n33% | 50% | Emerald | Chainmail Boots | 12 | 0.2 | 5\nJourneyman | 5 | 100% | 40% | Lava Bucket | Emerald | 12 | 0.05 | 20\n6 | 100% | 40% | Diamond | Emerald | 12 | 0.05 | 20\n7 | 33% | 40% | Emerald | Chainmail Helmet | 12 | 0.2 | 10\n33% | 40% | 4 ×Emerald | Chainmail Chestplate | 12 | 0.2 | 10\n33% | 40% | 5 ×Emerald | Shield | 12 | 0.2 | 10\nExpert | 8 | 50% | 100% | 19–33 ×Emerald | Enchanted Diamond Leggings[t 1] | 3 | 0.2 | 15\n50% | 100% | 13–27 ×Emerald | Enchanted Diamond Boots[t 1] | 3 | 0.2 | 15\nMaster | 9 | 50% | 100% | 13–27 ×Emerald | Enchanted Diamond Helmet[t 1] | 3 | 0.2 | 30\n50% | 100% | 21–35 ×Emerald | Enchanted Diamond Chestplate[t 1] | 3 | 0.2 | 30\n\n- ↑ a b c d When creating an enchantment offer, the game uses a random enchantment level from 5 to 19.

It is possible for a librarian to sell the same book more than once.\nThe price in emeralds depends on the enchantment level and \"treasure\" status. The minimum price of a book is given by 2 + 3 * (enchantment level), while the maximum price is 6 + 13 * (enchantment level). The possible values are 5–19 emeralds for Lvl I, 8–32 for Lvl II, 11–45 for Lvl III, 14–58 for Lvl IV, and 17–71 for Lvl V. For treasure enchantments the price is doubled. The cost is capped at 64 emeralds. All values below this cap are equally probable.\n- ↑ In Java Edition only one is requested per trade because of MC-248042 — Librarian's book and quill trade is always discounted to 1 since books are unstackable. In Bedrock Edition , the second book is placed in another slot instead.\nH4: Villager Trade Rebalance\nIf the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment is turned on, librarians offer specific enchanted books depending on which biome they come from.

    "url": "https://minecraft.wiki/w/Brewing",
    "content": "H1: Brewing\nBrewing is the process of creating potions , splash potions , lingering potions , and medicine ‌ [ Minecraft Education only ] by adding various ingredients to water bottles in a brewing stand .\nH2: Brewing equipment\n\nTABLE:\nName | Icon | Use\nBrewing stand | Used to brew potions using ingredients and water.\nWater | A water source block can be used to fill infinite glass bottles.\nBlaze powder | Fuels the brewing stand. Holds 20 charges.\nWater bottle | The starting base for all potions, made by filling aglass bottlefrom acauldronor awatersource block.\n\nH2: Ingredients\nThere is no provided in-game recipe book for brewing.\nH3: Base ingredients and modifiers\nBase ingredients are ingredients that can be added directly to a water bottle . Nether warts are used to make awkward potions, and are the fundamental of the base ingredients, as it is required to make the majority of potions.\nModifiers are ingredients used to alter the properties of a potion or to change a potion effect into a different one. The fermented spider eye is unique as it is the only modifier that can convert a water bottle directly into a usable potion .\n\nTABLE:\nName | Icon | When added to water bottle | When added as a modifier\nNether wart | Awkward potion | —\nRedstone dust | Mundane potion | Extends the duration of a potion.\nGlowstone dust | Thick potion | Increases the level of a potion.\nFermented spider eye | Potion of Weakness | Changes the effect of a potion.\nGunpowder | Splash water bottle | Turns a potion into a splash potion.\nDragon's breath | Lingering water bottle(from splash water bottle) | Turns a splash potion into a lingering potion.\n\nH4: Enhancement\nGenerally, upgrading a potion involves a trade-off between duration and potency. A potion with an enhanced effect has shorter duration, and a potion with extended duration cannot have an enhanced effect. However:\n- Upgrading the effect of a potion that has no time parameter (e.g. Instant Health ) with glowstone dust involves no trade-off.\n- Increasing the time of a potion that has no effects with different levels (e.g. Fire Resistance ) with redstone dust involves no trade-off.\nH4: Corrupting effect\nA fermented spider eye changes a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion.\n- A corrupted potion usually does the opposite of the original effect.\n- Corrupting an enhanced or extended potion into an effect that supports the modifier results in a potion with the same modifier applied. Enhanced potions of Leaping or Swiftness cannot be corrupted. In Bedrock Edition , potions of Strength II corrupt into regular potions of Weakness .\n- Enhanced potions of Leaping or Swiftness cannot be corrupted.\n- In Bedrock Edition , potions of Strength II corrupt into regular potions of Weakness .\n- A potion of Invisibility is considered the \"corrupted\" version of a potion of Night Vision .\n- Enhanced potions of Leaping or Swiftness cannot be corrupted.\n- In Bedrock Edition , potions of Strength II corrupt into regular potions of Weakness .\nH4: Splash and lingering potions\nBy adding gunpowder, a drinking potion can be turned into a splash potion , which can be thrown to coat entities within the place of impact with a status effect. Subsequently, adding dragon's breath to a splash potion makes a lingering potion, creating a cloud that inflicts effects on entities that enter its area.\n- Splash potions and lingering potions can be modified in the same manner as their normal counterparts. For instance, a splash water bottle can be brewed with any of the base ingredients; the result remains a splash potion.\n- The lingering potions can also be used to craft their respective versions of tipped arrows . In Bedrock Edition there is an easier way of using cauldrons for the same effect .\n- In Bedrock Edition there is an easier way of using cauldrons for the same effect .\n- Splash potions have the same duration as the drinkable form.\n- Lingering potions have only one-fourth of the duration of the drinkable form. For instance, a drinkable potion effect of 8:00 is reduced to 2:00 as a lingering potion.\n- In Bedrock Edition there is an easier way of using cauldrons for the same effect .\nH3: Effect ingredients\nEffect ingredients imbue an awkward potion with a particular effect but do not alter potion duration or intensity. When added directly to a water bottle, most of these ingredients produce a mundane potion. The exceptions to this are the golden carrot, pufferfish, turtle shell, and phantom membrane, which cannot be added directly to a water bottle. A corrupted version of a potion can be made by adding a fermented spider eye to it.\n\nTABLE:\nName | Icon | Effect | Effect when corrupted\nSugar | Speed | Slowness\nRabbit's foot | Jump Boost\nGlistering melon slice | Instant Health | Instant Damage\nSpider eye | Poison\nPufferfish | Water Breathing | None\nMagma cream | Fire Resistance\nGolden carrot | Night Vision | Invisibility\nBlaze powder | Strength | None‌[JEonly]Weakness‌[BEonly]\nGhast tear | Regeneration | None\nTurtle shell | Slowness+Resistance\nPhantom membrane | Slow Falling\nBreeze rod | Wind Charged\nStone | Infested\nCobweb | Weaving\nSlime block | Oozing\n\nH2: Brewing recipes\nH3: Base potions\nBase potions are potions without effects, brewed by adding a single base ingredient to a water bottle. Of these, only the awkward potion can be imbued with an effect ingredient to create a potion with an effect.‌ [ Java Edition only ]\n\nTABLE:\nPotion | Recipe(s) | Precursor to\nAwkward potion | Effect potions\nMundane potion | None‌[JEonly]Potion of Weakness‌[BEonly]\nThick potion | None‌[JEonly]Potion of Weakness‌[BEonly]\n\nH3: Effect potions\nEffect potions are primarily created by adding an effect ingredient to an awkward potion, which is created by adding nether wart to a water bottle. Certain effects require a potion to be corrupted by a fermented spider eye. The potion of Weakness can additionally be created by simply adding a fermented spider eye to a water bottle, and it is the only potion that can be brewed without nether wart .\nUndead mobs react differently to effects than other mobs.

This costs experience points based on the enchantment and its level.\n\nH2: Enchanting methods\nThere are four ways to enchant an item in Survival mode:\n- Using an enchanting table , place an unenchanted item and lapis lazuli in their respective slots, and apply an enchantment at the cost of experience .\n- Using an anvil , combine an enchanted book with an item.\n- Using an anvil, combine two of the same item with different existing enchantments into a single item that has the enchantments of both.\n- A librarian villager may enchant books in exchange for emeralds, granting the player experience just like every trade .\nA player may also obtain items already enchanted:\n- A villager may trade some enchanted items for emeralds .\n- Fishing gives a chance of obtaining enchanted items.\n- A zombie , drowned , husk , piglin , skeleton , bogged , stray , wither skeleton , and zombified piglin , if it has an enchanted item and is killed by a player , has an 8.5% chance to drop each individual item.\n- Treasure chests in locations such as end cities , ancient cities , shipwrecks , mineshafts , monster rooms , desert pyramids , jungle pyramids , woodland mansions , ocean ruins , strongholds , ruined portals , pillager outposts , and bastion remnants may contain enchanted items.\n- To barter with piglins, give them gold, and they have a small chance to drop an enchanted book or iron boots with the Soul Speed enchantment (random level 1-3).\n- In Bedrock Edition , pillagers and vindicators in raids may drop enchanted items.\nServer operators and players in singleplayer worlds with cheats enabled can also enchant items using commands such as / enchant . When enchanted with the / give command, the maximum enchantment level is 255 on Java Edition. In Creative mode, items can be enchanted via an anvil and enchanted books , with no experience points required. Enchanted books are available in the Creative mode inventory, with individual book displays for the highest level of each enchantment and other levels available via the \"Search\" tab.\nThe enchanted golden apple , despite its name and glint, is not the enchanted form of any item and is completely different from the golden apple .\nH3: Enchanting table\nAn item can be enchanted by using an enchanting table and placing the item and 1–3 lapis lazuli in the input slots. Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The glyphs, written in Standard Galactic Alphabet , do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied. On mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the lapis lazuli or hold the enchantment before release. The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a lapis lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 30 enchantment can give a pickaxe the \"Efficiency II\" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of lapis lazuli required have no effect.\nAlthough the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the lapis lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, but pay only 3 levels and 3 lapis lazuli.\nThe level requirement influences the quantity, type, and level of enchantments instilled in the item, with a higher experience level generally resulting in more and/or higher-level enchantments. Nevertheless, there is a significant random factor, and even a level 30 enchantment (the maximum) doesn't guarantee more than one enchantment, or even that enchantments are \"maximum strength\" — a level 30 enchantment can still yield Fortune II or Efficiency III alone, for example. On the other hand, it is possiblе for multiple different enchantments to be given from one use of the enchanting table. For example, a level 30 enchantment applied to a pickaxe may yield both Efficiency IV and Unbreaking III. However, certain selected enchants never give any additional enchantment, regardless of which tool is enchanted, such as Efficiency IV and Knockback II.‌ [ BE only ] [ verify ]\nTo increase the enchantment level, bookshelves can be placed next to the enchanting table while keeping one block of air between them. To gain access to the previously mentioned level 30 enchantments, a minimum of 15 bookshelves need to be placed around the enchanting table. See the Enchantment Mechanics page for more detailed information on this.\nEnchanting a book produces an enchanted book, which does nothing on its own, but effectively \"saves\" the enchantment for later application to another item with an anvil .\nUnlike with an anvil, using the enchanting table while on Creative still costs experience. However, if the player doesn't have enough experience, then experience reduces to zero and the enchantment still works, even when using the enchanting table while already at level zero.\nH4: Affecting offered enchantments\nEnchanting any item at any enchantment level changes the player's enchantment seed, which changes the possible enchantments for every item at every enchantment level. Thus, if none of the available enchantments for a tool are desired, 1 lapis lazuli and 1 level could be spent to enchant a book or a different tool to refresh the list.\nThe possible enchantments depend on the player's enchantment seed, the item type, and material, and the enchantment level (1–30). The following actions do not affect the possible enchantments:\n- removing the item and putting it back in\n- clicking on the item slot with a different item\n- using a different item of the same type and material\n- replacing or moving the table (but keeping the same number of bookshelves)\n- using a different table with the same number of bookshelves, or\n- replacing or rearranging the bookshelves without changing their total number.\nChanging the enchantment levels offered by adding, removing, or blocking bookshelves alters the enchantments shown, but does not change possible enchantments; using another enchanting table with the previous bookshelf number still shows the previous enchantments. The enchantments for a particular enchantment level (with the same seed and item) do also differ depending on which row they appear in, but they are not \"better\" or \"worse\" based on the row despite the different resource costs.\nH3: Anvil combinations\nAn anvil can be used to combine the enchantments of two items , sacrificing one of them and repairing the other. The items must be compatible; they must either be the same type and material (such as two iron swords) or an item and an enchanted book with an applicable enchantment (such as a bow and an Infinity enchanted book).\nCombining two enchanted items, books or one of each with the same enchantment at the same level produces an item or book with the next higher level of that enchantment up to the maximum allowed in Survival mode; for example, a book with Thorns I and Unbreaking II combined with a book with Unbreaking II produces a book with Thorns I and Unbreaking III.\nTo combine items, the player places the target item in the anvil's first slot and the sacrifice item in the second slot. If the combination is allowed, the resulting enchanted item appears in the anvil's output slot and an experience level cost, labeled \"Enchantment Cost\", appears below (green if the player has enough experience levels, red if they don't). To complete the enchanting, the player removes the enchanted item from the anvil's output slot, and their experience level is reduced accordingly.\nThe experience cost depends on the enchantments, with highly enchanted items costing more. If the target item is also being repaired, that costs more as well. The target item can also be renamed, at additional cost. There is also an accumulating surcharge for prior work done on anvils. In Survival mode, work that costs more than 39 levels of experience is refused although it may still be possible to perform the same work in steps. For example, a damaged enchanted bow may be repaired on an anvil with an ordinary bow, and then another enchanted bow may be used to combine enchantments with the repaired bow.\nH3: Enchanted books\nEnchanted books can be made by enchanting a book in an enchanting table at the cost of experience points. They can also be found in the chests of several structures, purchased with emeralds from a librarian villager, or caught while fishing.\nEnchanted books can be applied to tools, weapons, and armor, or combined with other enchanted books in an anvil . In this way, some enchantments that cannot normally be obtained on an item through use of the enchanting table can still be applied to those items, such as applying Thorns to boots.\nAlthough enchanted books can have multiple enchantments of any type, only enchantments appropriate to a given item type are applied to that item when combined in an anvil. For example, an enchanted book may have both the Respiration and Power enchantments, but the Respiration enchantment is lost if the book is applied to anything but a helmet. Likewise, the Power enchantment is lost if the book is applied to anything but a bow.\nIn Creative mode, enchanted books can be used to apply any enchantment to any item, such as a stick having Knockback II on Java Edition. However, mutually-exclusive enchantments, such as Infinity and Mending , cannot be applied this way or even via / enchant (though both enchantments function as normal when obtained on a bow through the / give command).\nThe experience costs for using books are considerably less than for combining items with similar enchantments since the books themselves cost levels to create. However, it's still an extra cost, and enchanting items directly has a chance to get multiple enchantments. The advantage of books is that they can be stockpiled for use on an item of choice and allow for controlled combinations. For example, a Silk Touch book can be used on an axe , pickaxe , or shovel , and the player can decide which item receives which enchantment.\nH4: Best Enchanting order\nUse Order Calculator to minimize experience loss when merging two items.\nH2: Disenchanting\nThe main way to disenchant items is via the grindstone or by repairing the items via the crafting grid. Using the grindstone removes all enchantments (except for curses ) but gives some experience back based on the level of the enchantment(s) and their value.\nIf a block is placed, it loses all the enchantments it has.\nH2: Summary of enchantments\nEach enchantment in the table below includes attributes that are possible for the player to acquire legitimately in Survival mode. Other combinations are possible in Creative mode or with cheats, mods, or third-party software.\n- Max Level: Maximum levels for enchantments vary, but the game can comprehend up to 32-bit integer values (−2 31 to 2 31 −1). Exceeding this value results in an overflow, and eventually resets itself to 0.\n- Primary Items: The items that can receive the enchantment legitimately in Survival mode by using an enchanting table . Items of any material can be enchanted (some more easily than others – see Enchantment mechanics ).\n- Secondary Items: Items that, in Survival mode, cannot receive the enchantment from an enchanting table but can from an enchanted book with an anvil.\n- Weight: Relative probability of the enchantment being offered.\n\nTABLE:\nName | Summary | Treasure[note 1] | Tradable[note 2] | IncompatibleWith | MaxLevel | PrimaryItems | SecondaryItems | Weight\nAqua Affinity | Removes the mining speed reduction that occurs when underwater. | No | Yes | I | 2\nBane of Arthropods | Increases damage and appliesSlownessIV toarthropodmobs (spiders, cave spiders, silverfish, endermites and bees). | No | Yes | Smite, Sharpness, Breach, Density | V | ‌[BEonly] | ‌[JEonly] | 5\nBlast Protection | Reduces explosion damage and knockback. | No | Yes | Fire Protection, Protection, Projectile Protection | IV | 2\nBreach | Reduces the effectiveness ofarmoron the target, including innate armor points. | No | Yes | Density, Bane of Arthropods, Smite, Sharpness | IV | 2\nChanneling | During thunderstorms, a thrown trident summons a lightning bolt on the target upon hit. | No | Yes | Riptide | I | 1\nCurse of Binding | Items cannot be removed from armor slots. | Yes | Yes | I | 1\nCurse of Vanishing | Item disappears on death. | Yes | Yes | I | ‌[BEonly] | 1\nDensity | Increases the damage of a mace's smash attack. | No | Yes | Breach, Bane of Arthropods, Smite, Sharpness | V | 5\nDepth Strider | Lessens the movement speed reduction that occurs when in water. | No | Yes | Frost Walker | III | 2\nEfficiency | Increasesmining efficiency. | No | Yes | V | 10\nFeather Falling | Reduces fall damage. | No | Yes | IV | 5\nFire Aspect | Sets targets on fire. | No | Yes | II | 2\nFire Protection | Reduces fire damage and burning time. | No | Yes | Blast Protection, Protection, Projectile Protection | IV | 5\nFlame | Fired arrows are burning, setting targets on fire. | No | Yes | I | 2\nFortune | Chance to receive more item drops from certain blocks. | No | Yes | Silk Touch | III | 2\nFrost Walker | Turns water intofrosted icebeneath the wearer's feet, and provides immunity tocampfireandmagma blockdamage. | Yes | Yes | Depth Strider | II | 2\nImpaling | InJava Edition, increases damage against aquatic mobs.

If a treasure enchantment is tradable, it has double the price (before capping to 64 emeralds) compared to a non-treasure enchantment of the same level.\n- ↑ Tradable enchantments are those that can be generated on Enchanted Books sold by librarians . This does not cover book trading options in the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment. Randomly enchanted tradable equipment generates only non-treasure enchantments.\nH2: Summary of enchantments by item\nEnchantments that have multiple levels are shown with their maximum level numbers. Mutually exclusive enchantments can be combined using commands (e.g., / give @s bow[enchantments={infinity:1,mending:1}] ). Also, a player can exceed the maximum levels of enchantments (e.g., / give @s netherite_sword[enchantments={fire_aspect:10}] ).

    "title": "Mobs",
    "url": "https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob",
    "content": "H1: Mob\nA mob (short for mobile , mobile entity , or mobile object ) [ 1 ] is an AI-driven game entity . All mobs can be attacked or hurt (from falling , attacked by a player or another mob, falling into the void , hit by an arrow , etc, with the exception of protected creakings ), and have some form of voluntary movement. Different types of mobs often have unique AI and loot .\nH2: Spawning\nMobs spawn in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on the light level , biome , and their surroundings. For example, most animals are found in bright areas on the surface, while hostile monsters are commonly found in the dark (whether it's a cave , monster room , mansion , or at night). Animals usually spawn upon chunk generation, while hostile monsters spawn and despawn in a certain radius around the player.\nSome mobs, including passive and neutral animals, and even hoglins , have the ability to be bred by the player , creating offspring. Villagers cannot be directly bred by the player, instead randomly breeding depending on the time of day and the number of beds , which allows players to manipulate their likelihood of breeding.\nMost mobs never spawn on transparent blocks, in water (except fish, dolphins, turtles, and other aquatic creatures), in lava (except for striders ), on bedrock , or on blocks less than a full block tall (such as slabs placed on the bottom half). The exception is monster spawners , from which monsters can spawn naturally on any block including air .\nSome mobs (like the snow golem and the wither ) require that the player \"construct\" them before being able to spawn. The iron golem can spawn naturally and can also be constructed. The ender dragon can be respawned with four end crystals . A rare occurrence of spawning are the jockey mobs, which is a mob riding another mob.\nPlayers can also spawn mobs easily by using spawn eggs in Creative mode or the / summon command.\nH3: Despawning\nMany mobs despawn (cease to exist) after a certain amount of time if far enough from the player. In Java Edition , most passive mobs do not despawn, while most monsters do. In Bedrock Edition , almost all mobs despawn. Mobs can be prevented from despawning if they are named with a name tag , and in Java Edition [ verify ] , also in a boat .\nH2: Behavior\nMobs are affected by the environment in the same ways as the player; they are subject to physics , and they can be hurt by the same things that harm the player (catching on fire, falling, drowning, attacks from weapons, the /kill command, etc.). Some mobs may be resistant or immune to certain hazards, such as some Nether mobs, which are immune to fire. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning. Mobs can ride minecarts and other mobs can climb up ladders . When mobs are killed, they turn to smoke particles and drop items that may be useful resources.\nEach type of mob in Minecraft has a certain AI (artificial intelligence) system with different behaviors and mechanics. Mobs ordinarily wander around at random if there is a player within 32 blocks and usually avoid walking off blocks high enough to cause falling damage. Many mobs have an advanced path-finding system that allows them to navigate through obstacles to get to a desired object or destination. Passive mobs flee in random directions after being hurt, while hostile mobs face and chase/attack the player as soon as the player comes close. Neutral mobs remain neutral until a player or mob provokes it (usually by attacking), at which point the neutral mob becomes hostile toward and attacks the entity that hit it. Most mobs are aware of players within (a Euclidian distance ) 16 blocks of them, but some can see farther. Conversely, most mobs can be heard by players up to 16 blocks away. Mobs are harmless to players in Creative mode.\nMost mobs cannot see through most solid blocks, including semi-transparent blocks such as ice , glass , tall grass , or glass panes . In Java Edition , all mobs (except for wardens [ 2 ] ) try to avoid walking over rails unless pushed onto the rails by other mobs.\nUsing specific name tags on mobs can result in unusual behavior or rendering. See Name Tag § Easter eggs for details.\nH2: List of mobs\nMobs are listed and classified by their nature from the player's perspective. For more details on a particular mob, click on them to view their individual page.\nH3: Passive mobs\nPassive mobs are harmless mobs (except for pufferfish ) that do not attempt to attack the player, even when provoked or attacked, though some of them may attack other mobs.

    "content": "H1: Block\nBlocks are the basic units of structure in Minecraft that make up the game's world. Many blocks can be collected and placed anywhere, as well as be used as helpful resources.\nH2: Behavior\nBlocks are arranged in a 3-dimensional grid of 1-cubic-meter cells, although some blocks appear to occupy a partial cell; these include slabs , snow layers, ladders , vines , stairs , turtle eggs , and sea pickles , among others.\nCollectively, blocks and fluids make up the in-game environment, and most can be harvested and utilized in various fashions. Some blocks, such as dirt and sandstone , are opaque and occupy their entire cubic meter, while others, such as glass and flowers , are transparent or non-solid. Explosions destroy some blocks more easily than they destroy others, while some are virtually immune to explosions. They can still be theoretically exploded.\nAir is a special block that acts as a substitute for the absence of blocks. It has two variants: cave air and void air .‌ [ Java Edition only ]\nSome blocks, such as sea lanterns and glowstone , emit light , the amount of which varies widely; see this table of light values for further information. Opaque blocks completely block light, while transparent blocks have no effect on light, block the light, or merely weaken it.\nAlmost all blocks ignore gravity, except for sand , red sand , gravel , anvils of all damage levels, dragon eggs , all colors of concrete powder , scaffolding , snow layers‌ [ BE only ] , pointed dripstone , suspicious sand , and suspicious gravel . These turn into entities when their support is removed.\nWhen broken, blocks emit sounds and particles associated with themselves, except in the following cases:\n- If the block is affected by gravity and falls into an invalid space (If the block is gravity based and drops onto a torch, for example). [ 1 ]\n- Anvils that are destroyed by running out of durability or falling. Only particles are missing. [ 2 ]\n- If the block can be washed away and is washed away by a flowing fluid. [ 3 ]\n- If the block can be replaced by other blocks and is replaced. [ 4 ]\n- If the block is one of a few blocks such as rails or redstone wire, supported by another block and its supporting block is removed. [ 5 ]\n- If the block is leaves and decays. [ 6 ]\nH2: Block height\nMost solid blocks are 1 meter high (3.28084... feet or 1250 ⁄ 381 feet), but several blocks have non-standard block heights, such as slabs .\nA player can automatically step up from a lower to a higher height if the difference is at most 0.6 ( 3 ⁄ 5 ) of a block or 1.9685... feet ( 250 ⁄ 127 feet).\nH2: Textures\nThe textures on the faces of most blocks are 16×16 pixels. Exceptions include candles , sculk sensors , etc. Most blocks are proportionately one cubic meter by default, but their shape can be changed using models .\nMost blocks have static textures, but these blocks are animated : water , lava , Nether portal , end portal , end gateway , prismarine (slab; stairs; wall), sea lantern , magma block , seagrass , kelp , fire , lantern , lit campfire and their soul variants, lit blast furnace , heat block ‌ [ BE & edu only ] , stems , hyphae , lit smoker , stonecutter , sculk , sculk shrieker , sculk sensor , calibrated sculk sensor , sculk vein , and command block .\nPlayers can change their textures by changing their files in-game. The following explains how. In the menu, go to \"Options\", then select the \"Resource Pack\" option. Two panels appear: \"Available\" and \"Selected\" (the Default resource pack should be under \"Selected\").\n- If there is any resource pack under \"Available\", drag it into \"Selected\", then click \"Done\". The resource pack should be active in a few moments.\n- If there is none, click \"Open Pack Folder\". This redirects you to the game directory. If you have a file or folder containing the resource pack, move it here. Go back to the game, exit the menu, and then enter to the \"Resource Pack\" option again. Your file should now be there. Drag it as described in the first point above.\nUsing resource packs , the player can change the textures and resolution of blocks, including whether their texture is animated. They can also change the shapes of blocks using models and the size of blocks to any size with equal width and height, though sizes that are a power of two tend to work better.\nH2: List of blocks\n-

    "content": "H1: Item\nAn item is an object that can exist within inventories of players , mobs , or armor stands ; in various storage blocks (like chests or droppers ), as well as in item frames and glow item frames .\nH2: Behavior\nSome items, when used , place a block (ItemBlock) or entity (minecart, spawn eggs, etc.) version of themselves into the game world. Put simply, they are an item when in the inventory , and a block when placed. For example, boats turn into an entity when placed, and beds turn into a group of blocks when placed. When selected in the hotbar , items briefly display their names above the HUD .\nThe only method by which an item can be properly displayed within the game environment is to place it into an item frame .\nH3: Thrown items\nIf an item that does not become a block is dropped, it becomes an entity represented by a sprite that floats above the ground. It remains for 5 minutes in a loaded chunk before despawning (except for the nether star ), unless the player walks over it to pick it up, it is picked up by a mob, hopper or minecart with hopper , or it is destroyed by fire , lava , cactus , explosion , void , or / kill .\nA submerged object ascends toward the water's surface. If the water is flowing, the object is pushed along with it.\nHoppers draw in any items that are placed above them if they are not powered by redstone.\n\nTABLE:\nThrown item properties\nDrag-H | 0.99 | Gravity | -0.04m/tick2\nDrag-Y | 0.98\nTicking order | 3\nLaunch angle calculator[note 1]\nGiven a target coordinate and an initial speed, calculate the thrown item launch angle to hit the target.Target is hit afterticks.\nX | 0–1 | Yaw | deg\nY | 0–1 | Pitch | degUnreachable1Direct hit\nZ | 0–1 | Speed | 0.6m/tick\n\n0.98\ndeg Unreachable 1 Direct hit\n- ↑ Yaw and pitch follow the Minecraft' s convention , thus zero yaw is directed at +Z (south) and looking upwards corresponds to negative values of pitch.\nH3: Stacking\nItems can either stack up to 64 or 16, or not stack at all:\n- Most items can stack to 64. This includes all blocks .\n- Some items, such as snowballs , empty buckets , eggs , signs , and ender pearls , can stack up to a maximum of 16.\n- Some other items do not stack at all, such as anything with a durability ( weapons , armor , and tools ), filled buckets , and potions .\n- All items can technically be forced to stack up to 99‌ [ JE only ] or 127‌ [ BE only ] using commands .\nH2: Lists of items\nH3: In the game\nH4: Items that create blocks, fluids or entities\nItems corresponding directly to blocks in name and ID are excluded from this list for the sake of brevity.\n- Acacia Boat\n- Acacia Boat with Chest\n- Armor Stand\n- Bamboo Raft\n- Bamboo Raft with Chest\n- Beetroot Seeds\n- Birch Boat\n- Birch Boat with Chest\n- Blue Egg\n- Bottle o' Enchanting\n- Bow\n- Brown Egg\n- Bucket\n- Bucket of Axolotl\n- Bucket of Cod\n- Bucket of Pufferfish\n- Bucket of Salmon\n- Bucket of Tadpole\n- Bucket of Tropical Fish\n- Carrot\n- Cherry Boat\n- Cherry Boat with Chest\n- Cocoa Beans\n- Crossbow\n- Dark Oak Boat\n- Dark Oak Boat with Chest\n- Egg\n- End Crystal\n- Ender Pearl\n- Eye of Ender\n- Fire Charge\n- Firework Rocket\n- Fishing Rod\n- Flint and Steel\n- Glow Berries\n- Glow Item Frame\n- Item Frame\n- Jungle Boat\n- Jungle Boat with Chest\n- Kelp\n- Lava Bucket\n- Lead\n- Lingering Potion\n- Mangrove Boat\n- Mangrove Boat with Chest\n- Melon Seeds\n- Minecart\n- Minecart with Chest\n- Minecart with Command Block\n- Minecart with Furnace ‌ [ JE only ]\n- Minecart with Hopper\n- Minecart with TNT\n- Nether Wart\n- Oak Boat\n- Oak Boat with Chest\n- Painting\n- Pale Oak Boat\n- Pale Oak Boat with Chest\n- Pitcher Pod\n- Potato\n- Powder Snow Bucket\n- Pumpkin Seeds\n- Redstone Dust\n- Snowball\n- Splash Potion\n- Spruce Boat\n- Spruce Boat with Chest\n- String\n- Sweet Berries\n- Torchflower Seeds\n- Trident\n- Water Bucket\n- Wheat Seeds\n- Wind Charge\nH4: Items with use in the world\nThese items, when highlighted in a player's hotbar (or \"held\"), in the off hand, or equipped in an armor slot, can be used by either attack or use , or can serve a specific purpose (for example, offer the player advantage or disadvantage).

    "content": "H1: Crafting\nCrafting is the process of constructing tools , items , and blocks in Minecraft that can be performed via the inventory , a crafting table , or automatically using a crafter .\nH2: Crafting system\nH3: Manual crafting\nPlayers in Survival and Adventure mode, as well as Creative in Bedrock Edition and Spectator in Java Edition , have access to a 2×2 crafting grid from their inventory screen. Players craft by arranging items in the crafting grid to match a given recipe. Small crafting recipes that are at most 2×2 can be made there, including wooden planks , sticks , crafting tables , and torches .\nTo craft more complex items, a crafting table must be created, placed, and used . This brings up an interface with a larger 3×3 crafting grid in which the player can use to craft any crafting recipe in the game. Recipes fitting the 2×2 grid can also be crafted in the crafting table's 3×3 grid. There is a recipe book button in the inventory where the player can access all of their unlocked crafting recipes.\nSome recipes don't require their ingredients to be arranged in a specific way on the crafting grid. These are commonly known as \"shapeless\" recipes. For example, players may craft a fermented spider eye by placing its ingredients anywhere within the grid.\nMost recipes must have their ingredients placed in the correct relative positions on the crafting grid. These are commonly known as \"shaped \" recipes. Ingredients in shaped recipes can be moved up, down, left, or right. They can also be flipped side-ways. For example, a 3×1 recipe, such as bread , can be made using the top, middle, or bottom row of the 3×3 grid, and a bow may be made with the strings placed on the left instead of on the right.\nThere are recipes that may not be moved or mirrored in this way. These are commonly known as \"fixed\" recipes. For example, dyes in banner recipes - only available in Bedrock Edition - must be specifically placed to achieve the desired pattern. No fixed recipes exist in Java Edition , but they can be added by data packs , add-ons , or mods .\nUnlike other in-game actions such as smelting , brewing , and enchanting , crafting is completely silent.\nH3: Automated crafting\nCrafting can be automated using the crafter .\nThe simplest way to do this is for the player to add the items for the crafting into the crafter manually, however this process can itself be automated using hoppers . In order to control which slots the hopper puts the item into it is possible to disable certain slots to prevent the input of items. When items are put into a crafter automatically they fill every enabled slot equally from left to right and top to bottom, in that order. If all slots are disabled, then hoppers connected to it cannot put items in it.\nThe crafter can craft anything that a normal crafting table can.\nCrafters require a redstone signal to activate.\nAutomated crafting is useful in both storage systems and automated farms , as it provides a way to automatically craft items and blocks that otherwise requires manual input.\nH3: Recipe book\nThe recipe book is a mechanic that serves as a catalog of recipes and as a crafting guide. It shows every crafting recipe that the player has unlocked.\nCrafting recipes are organized in several different categories. The categories differ between Java and Bedrock .\nIn Bedrock Edition , categories consist of craftable items from each Creative inventory tab.\nIn Java Edition , the categories are as follows:\n- The first tab contains every unlocked recipe.\n- The second tab contains utility items, tools , weapons , and armor .\n- The third tab contains building materials.\n- The fourth tab contains food , ingredients, and miscellaneous items.\n- The fifth tab contains redstone materials.\nH3: Recipe system\nRecipes, including crafting recipes, can be configured by data packs in Java Edition or add-ons in Bedrock Edition .\nH2: Achievements\n\nTABLE:\nIcon | Achievement | In-game description | Actual requirements (if different) | Gamerscore earned | Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 | Other\nTime to Mine! | Use planks and sticks to make apickaxe. | Pick up a woodenpickaxefrom acrafting tableoutput. | 10 | Bronze\nHot Topic | Construct a furnace out of eight cobblestone blocks. | Pick up afurnacefrom acrafting tableoutput. | 15 | Bronze\nTime to Farm! | Make a Hoe. | Pick up any type ofhoefrom acrafting tableoutput. | 10 | Bronze\nTime to Strike! | Use planks and sticks to make a sword. | Pick up any type ofswordfrom acrafting tableoutput. | 10 | Bronze"

    "title": "Smelting",
    "url": "https://minecraft.wiki/w/Smelting",
    "content": "H1: Smelting\nSmelting is the process of obtaining refined goods from raw materials by heating them in a furnace or blast furnace . When items are smelted in either type of furnace, experience is dropped. Like crafting , smelting uses recipes to determine what item is produced. Smelting is one of the two functions of a furnace (the second being cooking food ) and the sole function of a blast furnace .\nH2: Methods\nH3: Furnace\nThe furnace interface contains three item slots: the upper left slot for the item that needs to be smelted, the lower left slot for fuel, and the right slot where output items accumulate and can be retrieved by the player. Flames above the fuel slot act as a gauge showing the amount of fuel left of the current fuel item. An arrow in the middle shows the progress of smelting the current item.\nThe furnace takes 10 seconds (200 in-game ticks) to smelt an item. It begins to smelt if both input item and fuel are placed into the corresponding slots, and there is space in the output slot.\nWhen starting, a fuel item is consumed immediately, filling the fuel gauge. Different fuels will fuel the furnace for different amounts of time. The fuel gauge indicates how much of that fuel's burn time remains, and gradually decreases even if the input slot becomes empty. When a fuel item is fully consumed and the input slot is not empty, another one is taken from the fuel slot, and the gauge resets.\nThe furnace processes one input item at a time, which remains in the input slot during the 10-second process. So if multiple types of items or more than one stack of item need to be smelted, the player need to move in the item manually or using hoppers.\nThe arrow indicates the progress on how much the input has been smelted and how much more it needs to be smelted. When the arrow is full, the input item is removed from the input stack and an output item is added to the output stack. Smelting of the next input item then begins immediately.\nFurnaces stop smelting under any of four conditions:\n- When the furnace runs out of smeltable items: The input slot becomes empty or contains item that cannot be smelted.\n- The furnace runs out of fuel: The fuel input slot is empty, and the current fuel item is fully consumed (that is, the fuel gauge becomes empty).\n- The output slot becomes full: Either the slot has a full stack of the output, or the output contains the wrong output item for the current input item (for example, if the output contains iron ingots , but the input contains raw beef ). In this case, smelting (but not fuel consumption) is paused until the output slot becomes available (usually because items were removed by either a player or a hopper). If a fuel item burns out in this condition, a new one is not used until the output slot is again available.\n- The furnace is broken: The contents of all the slots, any accumulated experience, and the furnace itself are dropped. The currently-burning fuel item is lost since it is removed from the fuel slot before burning begins. The furnace block itself may not be dropped if it was destroyed by an explosion.\nIf smelting stops while a fuel item is still burning, the furnace continues to run visually, but no more input items are processed. If the fuel has been exhausted when an item has been partly smelted, the smelting progress is undone at double speed, and the item remains in the input stack.\nSmelting is suspended if the chunk the furnace is in becomes unloaded. It resumes when the chunk is loaded again.\nH3: Blast furnace and smoker\nSmokers and blast furnaces use the same GUI interface as regular furnaces and function similarly to regular furnaces. They smelt twice as quickly as furnaces, requiring only 5 seconds (100 game ticks) to smelt 1 item; they consume the same amount of fuel as regular furnaces per item smelted. Blast furnaces can only smelt ores, while smokers can only cook food; any other item can be smelted only in regular furnaces.\nH2: Recipes\nAll smelting recipes can be used in the furnace, but only subsets are available in the blast furnace and smoker.\nThe furnace, blast furnace and smoker keep track of experience for each item as smelting is completed for them, accumulating it in a hidden counter. The counter remembers the total earned experience even if a hopper is used to remove the items from the output slot. Experience is awarded to the player who uses the interface to remove items manually, after which the counter is reset. If the player takes some of the output but leaves some in the slot, the experience corresponding to items left in the furnace is retained and not awarded to the player. For fractional experience values, first multiply this value by the number of smelted items removed from the furnace, then award the player the integer part, and if there is a fractional part remaining, this represents the chance of an additional experience point.\n- For example, when smelting 1 coal ore and removing the coal, the value is 0.1, so every ten coal removed grants one experience point on average.\n- When smelting 6 sea pickles and removing all 6 lime dye , the value is 0.2×6 = 1.2, so this grants 1 point, plus a 20% chance of another 1 point.\n- The fractional experience stays within the furnace when the final total is not an integer, so the leftover experience is attributed to the next round of smelting.\nH3: Food\nAll food recipes can be used in a furnace or smoker. Food can alternatively be cooked on a campfire.\n\nTABLE:\nProduct | Ingredient | Exp | Usage\nBaked Potato | Potato | 0.35 | Fills5 (), while raw fills1 ().\nDried Kelp | Kelp | 0.1 | Fills1 ()and can be eaten faster than otherfoods; while uncooked kelp is inedible.

fuel burned in a furnace . When burned in a blast furnace or smoker , fuel is burned twice as fast but produces the same number of items.\n- ↑ Items in red are not stackable, items in yellow only stack up to 16.\n- ↑ Calculated as the burning time in seconds divided by the number of logs used to make one fuel when all wood ingredients are made from logs. Items in red are not made entirely of wood.\n- ↑ Calculated as the burning time in seconds divided by the amount of bamboo used to make one fuel when all wood ingredient are made from bamboo. Items in red are not made entirely of bamboo.\n- ↑ Requires 9 smelting operations to obtain, so net output is 11 operations.\n- ↑ 80 seconds of fuel per log, but 10 seconds are needed to smelt the charcoal, so the net time is 70 seconds.\n- ↑ a b c d e f Wooden slabs have the same burn time as planks due to a bug; see MCPE-94368 .\nH2: Hopper automation\nThe smelting process can be automated with hoppers on the top and bottom of the furnace. For larger smelting jobs, a third hopper on the side of the furnace can feed in fuel and, in case of lava being used as fuel, any empty buckets come out of the bottom hopper. This automatically feeds and empties the furnace so that different materials can be smelted in the same batch with no loss.\nWhenever a hopper or minecart with hopper removes items from a furnace, any experience earned from cooking or smelting the removed items is saved in the furnace and awarded to the next player who either breaks the furnace or manually removes an item from the furnace's output slot. This saved experience is in addition to that earned for the manually removed item(s).\nH2: Achievements\n\nTABLE:\nIcon | Achievement | In-game description | Actual requirements (if different) | Gamerscore earned | Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 | Other\nAcquire Hardware | Smelt an iron ingot | Pick up aniron ingotfrom afurnaceoutput. | 15 | Bronze\nDelicious Fish | Catch and cook a fish! | Pick up acooked codafter cooking it in afurnace,smoker,campfire, orsoul campfire.Note: This does not work if the block used is connected to a hopper underneath, as the player is not getting the item directly from the output. | 15 | Silver\nPork Chop | Cook and eat apork chop. | — | 10 | Bronze\nRenewable Energy | Smelt wood trunks using charcoal to make more charcoal. | Smelt a woodenlogwithcharcoalas the fuel. | 10 | Bronze\nDry Spell | Dry aspongein a furnace | — | 15 | Bronze\nSuper Fuel | Power aFurnacewith Lava | Smelt an item using a lava bucket on afurnace,blast furnaceorsmokerand pick up the resulting item from the output slot. | 20 | Bronze\nSmelt Everything! | Connect 3 Chests to a singleFurnaceusing 3Hoppers. | Be within the range of three chests connected to a Furnace with 3 Hoppers.Note: The demonstration shown in the image would not give the achievement. | 15 | Bronze\nRabbit Season | Cook and EatRabbit Meat | — | 15 | Bronze\n\nH2: Advancements\n\nTABLE:\nIcon | Advancement | In-game description | Actual requirements (if different)\nAcquire Hardware | Smelt an Iron Ingot | Have aniron ingotin the inventory.\n\nH2: Trivia\n- A wooden tool burns the same regardless of its remaining durability. A used-up tool is just as effective as fuel as a new tool.\n- \"Smelting\" is a broad term in the context of Minecraft while in the real world, smelting has a more precise definition. [ 8 ]"

player, or casual use in general.\nH3: Items\n- [](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Amethyst_farming)\n- [](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Armor_farming)\n-

    "content": "H1: Redstone circuits\nA redstone circuit is a build that is primarily focused on dealing with logic and redstone signals. Circuits can be used to transmit redstone signals, perform operations with logic gates , store data, shorten or lengthen redstone signals, make clocks, and more.\nA useful distinction can be made between a circuit performing operations on signals (generating, modifying, combining, etc.), and a mechanism using the environment (moving blocks, opening doors, changing the light level, producing sound, etc). Making this distinction allows us to talk about the various circuits separately, and let all players choose whichever circuits are useful for their purposes. The machines controlled by redstone circuits can range from simple devices such as automatic doors and light switches to complex devices such as elevators, automatic farms, or even in-game computers. However, this article provides only an overview of redstone circuits as above. These can be used to control simple mechanisms, or combined as parts of a larger build. Each circuit type on this page has links to its own page, which provides greater detail about them and give schematics for multiple variations of each.\nBefore working with any but the most basic redstone circuits, an understanding of some basic concepts is required: \"power\", \"signal strength\", \"redstone ticks\", \"block updates\", etc. Some relevant articles are listed below:\n- The Redstone mechanics article provides more information on these concepts.\n- The Redstone components article adds a list and description of all blocks that interact with redstone power in general.\n- The Mechanisms tutorial complements this article with an assortment of mechanism designs using circuits described here.\n- The Redstone tips tutorial gives general advice about building redstone mechanisms\nH2: Describing circuits\nMost circuits are described using Schematic diagrams; some of these require multiple images to show one or two layers per image. See the Help:Schematic page for details on how various blocks and components are represented.\nH3: Size\nThe wiki describes circuit size (the volume of the rectangular solid it occupies) with the notation of depth × width × height , including support/floor blocks, but not including inputs/outputs.\nAnother method used for describing circuit size in the Minecraft community is to ignore non-redstone blocks simply used for support (for example, blocks under redstone dust or repeaters). However, this method is unable to distinguish between flat and 1-high circuits, as well as some other circuit differences.\nSometimes it is convenient to compare circuits simply by the area of their footprint (e.g., 3×4 for a circuit three-block wide by four blocks long), or by a single dimension important in a particular context (e.g., length in a sequence of sub-circuits, height in a confined space, etc.).\nH3: Features\nSeveral features may be considered desirable design goals:\nOther design goals may include reducing the delay a sub-circuit adds to a larger circuit, reducing the use of resource-expensive components (redstone, nether quartz, etc.), and re-arranging or redesigning a circuit to make it as small as possible.\nSome components are not available before a player has access to the Nether, which limits the designs available. In particular, redstone comparators , observers and daylight detectors require nether quartz , which is available only from the Nether. Additionally, redstone lamps require glowstone , which is occasionally available from trading or witches , but is much more plentiful in the Nether.\nH2: Circuit types\nAlthough the number of ways to construct circuits is endless, certain patterns of construction occur repeatedly. The following sections attempt to categorize the circuits that have proven useful to the Minecraft community, while the main articles describe the specific circuits that fall into those categories.\nSome of these circuits might be used by themselves for simple control of mechanisms, but frequently the player needs to combine them into more complex circuits to meet the needs of a mechanism.\nH3: Transmission circuit\nSome aspects of signal transmission can be helpful to understand: transmission types, vertical transmission, repeaters, and diodes.\n\nTABLE:\n...\n\nH3: Logic circuit\nA logic gate is a circuit that takes one or more inputs and produces a single output when some condition has been met. The strength of the input signal in these circuits usually doesn't matter. When an input or output supplies a redstone signal, it is usually just referred to as \"on\", and when there is no signal, it is referred to as \"off\". For example, an AND gate takes two redstone signals as input, and outputs a redstone signal only if both inputs are greater than 0. That is, an AND gate is on only when both inputs are on.\nIn electronic or programming diagrams, logic gates are typically shown as if they were individual devices; However, when building redstone devices in Minecraft , all logic gates are formed from multiple blocks and components, which interact to produce the desired results.\n\nTABLE:\nA | On | On | Off | Off | Question Answered\nB | On | Off | On | Off\nA AND B | ON | Off | Off | Off | Are A and B on?\nNOT(A IMPLIES B) | Off | ON | Off | Off | Is A on and B off?\nNOT(B IMPLIES A) | Off | Off | ON | Off | Is B on and A off?\nA NOR B | Off | Off | Off | ON | Are both inputs off?\nA | ON | ON | Off | Off | Is A on?\nA XOR B | Off | ON | ON | Off | Are the inputs different?\nNOT A | Off | Off | ON | ON | Is A off?\nA XNOR B | ON | Off | Off | ON | Are the inputs the same?\nB | ON | Off | ON | Off | Is B on?\nNOT B | Off | ON | Off | ON | Is B off?\nA NAND B | Off | ON | ON | ON | Is either input off?\nA IMPLIES B | ON | Off | ON | ON | If A is on, is B also on?\nB IMPLIES A | ON | ON | Off | ON | If B is on, is A also on?\nA OR B | ON | ON | ON | Off | Is either input on?\n\nH3: Pulse circuit\nA pulse circuit produces a redstone signal for a specified amount of time, changes the duration of an input signal, or reacts to signals of a particular duration. Other circuits or mechanisms may require pulses of a particular duration to operate properly, or can use pulse duration to convey information.\nA circuit that is stable in one output state and unstable in the other is known as a monostable circuit . [ note 1 ] Many pulse circuits are monostable because their OFF state is stable, but their ON state soon reverts to OFF.\nH3: Clock circuit\nA clock circuit is a pulse generator that produces a loop of specific pulses repeatedly. Some are designed to run forever, while others can be stopped and started.\nA simple clock with only two states of equal duration is named for the duration of its ON state (e.g., for example, a clock that alternates between a 5-tick ON state and a 5-tick OFF state is called a 5-clock) while others are usually named for their period (the time it takes for the clock to return to its original state; for example, a \"1-minute clock\" might produce a 1-tick pulse every 60 seconds).\nH3: Memory circuit\nMemory circuits maintain their output until they receive a signal that tells them to change their output. In simple terms, memory circuits stay on or off until they receive a signal telling them to turn off or on. This means that a memory circuit's state (output) depends on the current input and the previous inputs. Most other circuits just temporarily generate an output based on the current input.\nMost memory circuits are called \"latches\" or \"flip-flops\"; these are named after real-life electronic circuits because they behave similarly. Some basic types of memory circuits are outlined below. See here for an explanation of technical terms.\nMemory circuits are named based on the kinds of input they take and any logic gates they use.\nMany other memory circuits are possible.\nH3: Piston circuits\nPistons allow players to design circuits that are smaller and/or faster than the standard, redstone-only counterparts. An understanding of standard redstone circuits is helpful, as this tutorial is focused on the circuit design rather than the function. The main components here are sticky pistons , regular pistons, redstone wire , repeaters and redstone torches .\nThere are several benefits of piston circuitry:\n- Neither repeaters nor pistons 'burn out', unlike redstone torches.\n- Piston circuits are often (not always) smaller and/or faster than their redstone counterparts. This allows building devices such as fast clocks and \"instant\" signal transmission.\n- Pistons' ability to move blocks within the world makes them a natural for memory circuits, as well as the obvious doorways and switchable bridges. With slime or honey blocks involved, entire structures can \"get up and move\" (see also tutorial on flying machines ).\n- Piston circuits can sharply reduce the use of redstone in favor of wood, stone, and iron.\nH3: Miscellaneous circuits\nThese circuits aren't generally needed for redstone projects, but might find use in complex projects, proofs of concept, and thought experiments. Some examples:\nH2: Achievements\n\nTABLE:\nIcon | Achievement | In-game description | Actual requirements (if different) | Gamerscore earned | Trophy type (PS)\nPS4 | Other\nInception | Push apistonwith a piston, then pull the original piston with that piston. | — | 20 | Silver\nCrafters Crafting Crafters | Be near aCrafterwhen it crafts a Crafter | — | 10 | Bronze"
