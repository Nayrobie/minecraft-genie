H1: Trading
Trading is a gameplay mechanic that allows players to exchange emeralds for items , and vice versa, with villagers and wandering traders .
H2: Mechanics
Pressing use on an adult villager with a profession, or on a wandering trader , opens a menu, allowing a player to trade with that merchant. This action pauses any pathfinding the merchant was doing and makes it face you. If the merchant takes damage while trading, the trading menu closes. The same thing happens if they walk or are transported far enough away.
All transactions involve emeralds . Trading is the only method of acquiring the globe banner pattern , woodland explorer map , trial explorer map , and ocean explorer map in Survival mode. It is also the only renewable way to obtain bells , diamond gear, [ note 1 ] lapis lazuli ‌ [ BE only ] , bottles o' enchanting , glass , sand , red sand , coral blocks , arrow of decay ,‌ [ BE only ] and small dripleaves .
H3: Level
Villagers have five career levels that can be increased by trading with them. Each villager starts at the novice level. A villager's level can be seen in the trading menu. The badge that a villager wears can also be identified: stone for a novice, iron for an apprentice, gold for a journeyman, emerald for an expert, and diamond for a master. Trading until the villager's trading bar gets full unlocks the next level of trades. When a player trades with a villager, both the villager and the player gain experience . All villager trades reward the player with 3–6 experience plus an additional 5 experience if the villager levels up with the trade. Trading with a wandering trader also rewards the player with some experience, although the trader does not have experience levels to gain. A villager levels up when its experience bar becomes full and gains up to two‌ [ JE only ] or three‌ [ BE only ] new trades and retains its existing trades. Additionally, a villager receives a Regeneration effect and becomes surrounded by purple particles for ten seconds.
Trades from the master level would still reward the villager with experience, but it has no actual effect as the villager can't level up any further.
Each badge is 2x3 pixels except the novice (stone) badge, which is 4x4 pixels.

TABLE:
Level | Badge | Name | Total villager experience required
1 | Novice | 0
2 | Apprentice | 10
3 | Journeyman | 70
4 | Expert | 150
5 | Master | 250

In Java Edition , villagers have a maximum of 10 trades. Each level unlocks a maximum of two new trades. If a level has a pool of more than two trades, the two offered trades are chosen randomly from the set.
In Bedrock Edition , villagers have 7–10 trade slots. A slot with multiple possible trades will display only one trade; for example, farmer villagers have 4 potential trades in their first trade slot, so each trade has a 1 ⁄ 4 chance to be chosen. [ until Villager Trade Rebalancing ] [ verify ]
A villager's profession dictates the trading pool used to determine its trades. For example, villagers wearing straw hats are farmers, so their trades are based on the Farmer trade pool. Each profession unlocks a predefined and finite set of offers. Different professions are assigned to each villager based on their job-site block. This profession is indicated by their appearance and in the trading interface. Novice villagers who have not traded can lose their profession and change back into unemployed villagers if their claimed job site block is removed. Removing and then replacing a job site block can alter the trades offered, and a villager with no experience resets its trades every so often. Once a player trades with a villager, the villager keeps its profession forever and subsequently locks in the offered trades.
H3: Trades
Each trade can be used a maximum number of times, after which the villager runs out of stock and trade becomes disabled. The exact number is different for each item and referenced in the tables below. When villagers work at their job site blocks , they activate their offers again, up to twice per day. In Bedrock Edition , villagers need to be linked to a bed to restock their trades (it is not necessary for them to sleep, but require a bed nearby). When an offer is disabled, a red "X" appears in the trading interface in Java Edition , or the trading slot becomes red in Bedrock Edition , and the villager displays the same particle effect as an offer being created.
When buying items from players, villagers ignore additional item data ; this allows, for example, selling renamed or enchanted items, as well as lodestone compasses instead of regular compasses in Java Edition . When the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment is enabled, taiga armorers can also accept damaged armor.
H3: Sale prices
The price of an item rises and falls depending on three factors. Items with a high price multiplier (0.2) are affected by these changes more than items with a low multiplier (0.05). All price fluctuations affect only the first item involved in trade; for example, for an initial trade of 32 sticks for 1 emerald, the price might be driven down to 1 stick or up to 64 sticks for 1 emerald, but never for 2 emeralds. Additionally, no quantity can go lower than 1 or higher than the stack size.
The first factor is demand. An item that was sold out gets a price increase for all players when resupplied. If a player does not trade for a higher-priced item, the price is reduced the next time the villager resupplies. Demand is tracked per item, not per villager , so a villager can offer a higher-priced trade for a single item while other items are cheaper. Trades that have a price multiplier of 0 are not affected by demand.
The second way to affect prices is the Hero of the Village effect, gained from successfully completing a raid, which temporarily reduces prices for the affected player depending on the level of the effect.
Finally, players get personal discounts or penalties‌ [ Java Edition only ] based on their reputation with a particular villager. A positive reputation is gained by curing zombie villagers (the cured villager gives a much larger permanent discount than the temporary discount given by nearby villagers). Giving a zombie villager the Weakness effect and then feeding it a golden apple starts the curing process. After five minutes, it transforms into a villager. The permanent discount is capped at one cure, while the temporary discount is capped at eight cures [ needs testing ] . Players can also gain negative reputation by hitting or killing villagers, and positive reputation by trading. In Bedrock Edition , negative reputation can reduce or eliminate discounts but does not result in penalties.
H2: Non-trading villagers
If the player attempts to trade with a non-trading villager in Java Edition , it grunts and bobs its head, but if the player tries to do the same thing in Bedrock Edition , nothing happens.
H3: Nitwit
Nitwits are green-coated villagers. They cannot gain a profession.
While they can be used for breeding, it is not possible to get a baby nitwit by breeding adult nitwits.
H3: Unemployed villager
Villagers without a job cannot trade. They only wear their biome outfits. An unemployed villager gains a profession by claiming an unclaimed job site block . For example, an unclaimed cartography table converts an unemployed villager into a cartographer when the villager claims it, and both the villager and the table emit green particles. An inaccessible (or destroyed) job site block causes the connected villager to lose its profession, but that does not affect the player's popularity in the village.
H3: Baby villagers
The appearance of baby villagers is the same as that of the corresponding adult unemployed villagers, but their bodies are smaller. They can't get a job and trade.
H2: Trade offers
The villager pictured on the right is from the plains biome. To see villager professions dressed for other biomes, see Villagers § Professions .
In Java Edition , starting from Novice, at each level two additional trades become available, unless there is only one trade within that level. If there are more than two possible trades, two are randomly selected.
In Bedrock Edition , one trade is chosen randomly from each slot available. For example, if there are two items on the same slot, then only one of them will show up in the trade.

- ↑ The structure that the map leads to depends on the biome the villager is from. See the table above for more details. Each of the three possible maps are counted as independent trades, so a villager trading multiple maps is possible.
- ↑ a b In Java Edition , all copies of the map traded by a particular villager lead to the same structure. In worlds that do not have the structure, this trade is not offered.
In Bedrock Edition , Cartographers adopting the profession in the Nether or the End do not offer explorer maps.
- ↑ The list of possible offers contains individual offers for each color, so multiple colors may be offered by the same villager as separate trades.

- ↑ a b c d The enchantment is chosen randomly with equal chance of any enchantment type occurring (except for Soul Speed , Swift Sneak , and Wind Burst ) and equal chance to get any level of the enchantment, meaning high-level enchantments are as likely as low-level enchantments. It is possible for a librarian to sell the same book more than once.
The price in emeralds depends on the enchantment level and "treasure" status. The minimum price of a book is given by 2 + 3 * (enchantment level), while the maximum price is 6 + 13 * (enchantment level). The possible values are 5–19 emeralds for Lvl I, 8–32 for Lvl II, 11–45 for Lvl III, 14–58 for Lvl IV, and 17–71 for Lvl V. For treasure enchantments the price is doubled. The cost is capped at 64 emeralds. All values below this cap are equally probable.
- ↑ In Java Edition only one is requested per trade because of MC-248042 — Librarian's book and quill trade is always discounted to 1 since books are unstackable. In Bedrock Edition , the second book is placed in another slot instead.
H4: Villager Trade Rebalance
If the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment is turned on, librarians offer specific enchanted books depending on which biome they come from. Enchantments for the Novice, Apprentice, and Journeyman book trades are randomly selected from the "Common" pool, with a randomized level. At Master level, librarians are guaranteed to sell an enchanted book with a specific enchantment.

H2: Notes
- ↑ Technically, diamond armor (not other types of diamond gear) can also be obtained renewably from zombies and skeletons; however, these mobs only have a 0.04% ( 1 ⁄ 25,000 ) chance to spawn with diamond armor, rendering this an extremely impractical way to obtain such armor.

PAGE NAME: BREWING
URL: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Brewing
========================================
H1: Brewing
Brewing is the process of creating potions , splash potions , lingering potions , and medicine ‌ [ Minecraft Education only ] by adding various ingredients to water bottles in a brewing stand .
H2: Brewing equipment

TABLE:
Name | Icon | Use
Brewing stand | Used to brew potions using ingredients and water.
Water | A water source block can be used to fill infinite glass bottles.
Blaze powder | Fuels the brewing stand. Holds 20 charges.
Water bottle | The starting base for all potions, made by filling aglass bottlefrom acauldronor awatersource block.

H2: Ingredients
There is no provided in-game recipe book for brewing.
H3: Base ingredients and modifiers
Base ingredients are ingredients that can be added directly to a water bottle . Nether warts are used to make awkward potions, and are the fundamental of the base ingredients, as it is required to make the majority of potions.
Modifiers are ingredients used to alter the properties of a potion or to change a potion effect into a different one. The fermented spider eye is unique as it is the only modifier that can convert a water bottle directly into a usable potion .

TABLE:
Name | Icon | When added to water bottle | When added as a modifier
Nether wart | Awkward potion | —
Redstone dust | Mundane potion | Extends the duration of a potion.
Glowstone dust | Thick potion | Increases the level of a potion.
Fermented spider eye | Potion of Weakness | Changes the effect of a potion.
Gunpowder | Splash water bottle | Turns a potion into a splash potion.
Dragon's breath | Lingering water bottle(from splash water bottle) | Turns a splash potion into a lingering potion.

H4: Enhancement
Generally, upgrading a potion involves a trade-off between duration and potency. A potion with an enhanced effect has shorter duration, and a potion with extended duration cannot have an enhanced effect. However:
- Upgrading the effect of a potion that has no time parameter (e.g. Instant Health ) with glowstone dust involves no trade-off.
- Increasing the time of a potion that has no effects with different levels (e.g. Fire Resistance ) with redstone dust involves no trade-off.
H4: Corrupting effect
A fermented spider eye changes a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion.
- A corrupted potion usually does the opposite of the original effect.
- Corrupting an enhanced or extended potion into an effect that supports the modifier results in a potion with the same modifier applied. Enhanced potions of Leaping or Swiftness cannot be corrupted.
- Enhanced potions of Leaping or Swiftness cannot be corrupted.
- A potion of Invisibility is considered the "corrupted" version of a potion of Night Vision .
- Enhanced potions of Leaping or Swiftness cannot be corrupted.
H4: Splash and lingering potions
By adding gunpowder, a drinking potion can be turned into a splash potion , which can be thrown to coat entities within the place of impact with a status effect. Subsequently, adding dragon's breath to a splash potion makes a lingering potion, creating a cloud that inflicts effects on entities that enter its area.
- Splash potions and lingering potions can be modified in the same manner as their normal counterparts. For instance, a splash water bottle can be brewed with any of the base ingredients; the result remains a splash potion.
- The lingering potions can also be used to craft their respective versions of tipped arrows . In Bedrock Edition there is an easier way of using cauldrons for the same effect .
- In Bedrock Edition there is an easier way of using cauldrons for the same effect .
- Splash potions have the same duration as the drinkable form.
- Lingering potions have only one-fourth of the duration of the drinkable form. For instance, a drinkable potion effect of 8:00 is reduced to 2:00 as a lingering potion.
- In Bedrock Edition there is an easier way of using cauldrons for the same effect .
H3: Effect ingredients
Effect ingredients imbue an awkward potion with a particular effect but do not alter potion duration or intensity. When added directly to a water bottle, most of these ingredients produce a mundane potion. The exceptions to this are the golden carrot, pufferfish, turtle shell, and phantom membrane, which cannot be added directly to a water bottle. A corrupted version of a potion can be made by adding a fermented spider eye to it.

TABLE:
Name | Icon | Effect | Effect when corrupted
Sugar | Speed | Slowness
Rabbit's foot | Jump Boost
Glistering melon slice | Instant Health | Instant Damage
Spider eye | Poison
Pufferfish | Water Breathing | None
Magma cream | Fire Resistance
Golden carrot | Night Vision | Invisibility
Blaze powder | Strength | None‌[JEonly]Weakness‌[BEonly]
Ghast tear | Regeneration | None
Turtle shell | Slowness+Resistance
Phantom membrane | Slow Falling
Breeze rod | Wind Charged
Stone | Infested
Cobweb | Weaving
Slime block | Oozing

H2: Brewing recipes
H3: Base potions
Base potions are potions without effects, brewed by adding a single base ingredient to a water bottle. Of these, only the awkward potion can be imbued with an effect ingredient to create a potion with an effect.‌ [ Java Edition only ]

TABLE:
Potion | Recipe(s) | Precursor to
Awkward potion | Effect potions
Mundane potion | None‌[JEonly]Potion of Weakness‌[BEonly]
Thick potion | None‌[JEonly]Potion of Weakness‌[BEonly]

H3: Effect potions
Effect potions are primarily created by adding an effect ingredient to an awkward potion, which is created by adding nether wart to a water bottle. Certain effects require a potion to be corrupted by a fermented spider eye. The potion of Weakness can additionally be created by simply adding a fermented spider eye to a water bottle, and it is the only potion that can be brewed without nether wart .
Undead mobs react differently to effects than other mobs. They take damage from potions of Healing , gain health from potions of Harming , and are unaffected by potions of Poison and Regeneration .

Of those, 19 potions had one of 8 different effects.
- By modifying the item NBT using an editor or commands , it is possible to get a potion that cannot be upgraded into a splash potion.

========================================
PAGE NAME: ENCHANTING
URL: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanting
========================================
H1: Enchanting
Enchanting is the process of augmenting armor , tools , and weapons . A glint animation appears on items to show that they are enchanted.
H2: Enchanting equipment

TABLE:
Name | Icon | Usage
Enchanting Table | Used to enchant items.
Bookshelf | Allows the enchanting table to apply higher-level enchantments. Each bookshelf increases the level requirement of enchantments given by the enchanting table by two, up to a max of 30 (or 15 bookshelves).
Lapis Lazuli | Required to power the enchanting table (up to three per item).
Anvil | Used to combine enchanted items (tools, armor, weapons, etc.), add enchantments from books, or repair an item while preserving enchantments. Each time an anvil is used on an item, the xp cost for future uses on that item increases exponentially
Grindstone | Used to remove all non-curse enchantments on an item, returning a small amount of experience, and optionally combine the durability of two items (plus an additional 5% durability) an item for no experience.
Enchanted Book | Can be combined with another item through an anvil to add certain enchantments to the item. This costs experience points based on the enchantment and its level.

H2: Enchanting methods
There are four ways to enchant an item in Survival mode:
- Using an enchanting table , place an unenchanted item and lapis lazuli in their respective slots, and apply an enchantment at the cost of experience .
- Using an anvil , combine an enchanted book with an item.
- Using an anvil, combine two of the same item with different existing enchantments into a single item that has the enchantments of both.
- A librarian villager may enchant books in exchange for emeralds, granting the player experience just like every trade .
A player may also obtain items already enchanted:
- A villager may trade some enchanted items for emeralds .
- Fishing gives a chance of obtaining enchanted items.
- A zombie , drowned , husk , piglin , skeleton , bogged , stray , wither skeleton , and zombified piglin , if it has an enchanted item and is killed by a player , has an 8.5% chance to drop each individual item.
- Treasure chests in locations such as end cities , ancient cities , shipwrecks , mineshafts , monster rooms , desert pyramids , jungle pyramids , woodland mansions , ocean ruins , strongholds , ruined portals , pillager outposts , and bastion remnants may contain enchanted items.
- To barter with piglins, give them gold, and they have a small chance to drop an enchanted book or iron boots with the Soul Speed enchantment (random level 1-3).
- In Bedrock Edition , pillagers and vindicators in raids may drop enchanted items.
Server operators and players in singleplayer worlds with cheats enabled can also enchant items using commands such as / enchant . When enchanted with the / give command, the maximum enchantment level is 255 on Java Edition. In Creative mode, items can be enchanted via an anvil and enchanted books , with no experience points required. Enchanted books are available in the Creative mode inventory, with individual book displays for the highest level of each enchantment and other levels available via the "Search" tab.
The enchanted golden apple , despite its name and glint, is not the enchanted form of any item and is completely different from the golden apple .
H3: Enchanting table
An item can be enchanted by using an enchanting table and placing the item and 1–3 lapis lazuli in the input slots. Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The glyphs, written in Standard Galactic Alphabet , do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied. On mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the lapis lazuli or hold the enchantment before release. The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a lapis lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 30 enchantment can give a pickaxe the "Efficiency II" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of lapis lazuli required have no effect.
Although the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the lapis lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, but pay only 3 levels and 3 lapis lazuli.
The level requirement influences the quantity, type, and level of enchantments instilled in the item, with a higher experience level generally resulting in more and/or higher-level enchantments. Nevertheless, there is a significant random factor, and even a level 30 enchantment (the maximum) doesn't guarantee more than one enchantment, or even that enchantments are "maximum strength" — a level 30 enchantment can still yield Fortune II or Efficiency III alone, for example. On the other hand, it is possiblе for multiple different enchantments to be given from one use of the enchanting table. For example, a level 30 enchantment applied to a pickaxe may yield both Efficiency IV and Unbreaking III. However, certain selected enchants never give any additional enchantment, regardless of which tool is enchanted, such as Efficiency IV and Knockback II.‌ [ BE only ] [ verify ]
To increase the enchantment level, bookshelves can be placed next to the enchanting table while keeping one block of air between them. To gain access to the previously mentioned level 30 enchantments, a minimum of 15 bookshelves need to be placed around the enchanting table. See the Enchantment Mechanics page for more detailed information on this.
Enchanting a book produces an enchanted book, which does nothing on its own, but effectively "saves" the enchantment for later application to another item with an anvil .
Unlike with an anvil, using the enchanting table while on Creative still costs experience. However, if the player doesn't have enough experience, then experience reduces to zero and the enchantment still works, even when using the enchanting table while already at level zero.
H4: Affecting offered enchantments
Enchanting any item at any enchantment level changes the player's enchantment seed, which changes the possible enchantments for every item at every enchantment level. Thus, if none of the available enchantments for a tool are desired, 1 lapis lazuli and 1 level could be spent to enchant a book or a different tool to refresh the list.
The possible enchantments depend on the player's enchantment seed, the item type, and material, and the enchantment level (1–30). The following actions do not affect the possible enchantments:
- removing the item and putting it back in
- clicking on the item slot with a different item
- using a different item of the same type and material
- replacing or moving the table (but keeping the same number of bookshelves)
- using a different table with the same number of bookshelves, or
- replacing or rearranging the bookshelves without changing their total number.
Changing the enchantment levels offered by adding, removing, or blocking bookshelves alters the enchantments shown, but does not change possible enchantments; using another enchanting table with the previous bookshelf number still shows the previous enchantments. The enchantments for a particular enchantment level (with the same seed and item) do also differ depending on which row they appear in, but they are not "better" or "worse" based on the row despite the different resource costs.
H3: Anvil combinations
An anvil can be used to combine the enchantments of two items , sacrificing one of them and repairing the other. The items must be compatible; they must either be the same type and material (such as two iron swords) or an item and an enchanted book with an applicable enchantment (such as a bow and an Infinity enchanted book).
Combining two enchanted items, books or one of each with the same enchantment at the same level produces an item or book with the next higher level of that enchantment up to the maximum allowed in Survival mode; for example, a book with Thorns I and Unbreaking II combined with a book with Unbreaking II produces a book with Thorns I and Unbreaking III.
To combine items, the player places the target item in the anvil's first slot and the sacrifice item in the second slot. If the combination is allowed, the resulting enchanted item appears in the anvil's output slot and an experience level cost, labeled "Enchantment Cost", appears below (green if the player has enough experience levels, red if they don't). To complete the enchanting, the player removes the enchanted item from the anvil's output slot, and their experience level is reduced accordingly.
The experience cost depends on the enchantments, with highly enchanted items costing more. If the target item is also being repaired, that costs more as well. The target item can also be renamed, at additional cost. There is also an accumulating surcharge for prior work done on anvils. In Survival mode, work that costs more than 39 levels of experience is refused although it may still be possible to perform the same work in steps. For example, a damaged enchanted bow may be repaired on an anvil with an ordinary bow, and then another enchanted bow may be used to combine enchantments with the repaired bow.
H3: Enchanted books
Enchanted books can be made by enchanting a book in an enchanting table at the cost of experience points. They can also be found in the chests of several structures, purchased with emeralds from a librarian villager, or caught while fishing.
Enchanted books can be applied to tools, weapons, and armor, or combined with other enchanted books in an anvil . In this way, some enchantments that cannot normally be obtained on an item through use of the enchanting table can still be applied to those items, such as applying Thorns to boots.
Although enchanted books can have multiple enchantments of any type, only enchantments appropriate to a given item type are applied to that item when combined in an anvil. For example, an enchanted book may have both the Respiration and Power enchantments, but the Respiration enchantment is lost if the book is applied to anything but a helmet. Likewise, the Power enchantment is lost if the book is applied to anything but a bow.
In Creative mode, enchanted books can be used to apply any enchantment to any item, such as a stick having Knockback II on Java Edition. However, mutually-exclusive enchantments, such as Infinity and Mending , cannot be applied this way or even via / enchant (though both enchantments function as normal when obtained on a bow through the / give command).
The experience costs for using books are considerably less than for combining items with similar enchantments since the books themselves cost levels to create. However, it's still an extra cost, and enchanting items directly has a chance to get multiple enchantments. The advantage of books is that they can be stockpiled for use on an item of choice and allow for controlled combinations. For example, a Silk Touch book can be used on an axe , pickaxe , or shovel , and the player can decide which item receives which enchantment.
H4: Best Enchanting order
Use Order Calculator to minimize experience loss when merging two items.
H2: Disenchanting
The main way to disenchant items is via the grindstone or by repairing the items via the crafting grid. Using the grindstone removes all enchantments (except for curses ) but gives some experience back based on the level of the enchantment(s) and their value.
If a block is placed, it loses all the enchantments it has.
H2: Summary of enchantments
Each enchantment in the table below includes attributes that are possible for the player to acquire legitimately in Survival mode. Other combinations are possible in Creative mode or with cheats, mods, or third-party software.
- Max Level: Maximum levels for enchantments vary, but the game can comprehend up to 32-bit integer values (−2 31 to 2 31 −1). Exceeding this value results in an overflow, and eventually resets itself to 0.
- Primary Items: The items that can receive the enchantment legitimately in Survival mode by using an enchanting table . Items of any material can be enchanted (some more easily than others – see Enchantment mechanics ).
- Secondary Items: Items that, in Survival mode, cannot receive the enchantment from an enchanting table but can from an enchanted book with an anvil.
- Weight: Relative probability of the enchantment being offered.

- ↑ Treasure enchantments are those that can't be obtained using an enchanting table and aren't generated on randomly enchanted equipment sold by villagers or worn by mobs. If a treasure enchantment is tradable, it has double the price (before capping to 64 emeralds) compared to a non-treasure enchantment of the same level.
- ↑ Tradable enchantments are those that can be generated on Enchanted Books sold by librarians . This does not cover book trading options in the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment. Randomly enchanted tradable equipment generates only non-treasure enchantments.
H2: Summary of enchantments by item
Enchantments that have multiple levels are shown with their maximum level numbers. Mutually exclusive enchantments can be combined using commands (e.g., / give @s bow[enchantments={infinity:1,mending:1}] ). Also, a player can exceed the maximum levels of enchantments (e.g., / give @s netherite_sword[enchantments={fire_aspect:10}] ). However, if that number goes above 10 the translation string is exposed and it looks like this:

- ↑ a b Only golden weapons can receive Sharpness V directly through the enchanting table. For all other weapon tiers (wooden, stone, iron, diamond, and netherite), an anvil is required to apply Sharpness V to them, though iron and diamond swords can generate with Sharpness V in end city and bastion remnant chests and iron axes with Sharpness V can be found in trial chambers barrels.
- ↑ Tools of any material except stone and diamond can receive up to Efficiency V through the enchanting table. Stone tools can receive up to level IV through the enchanting table, but can be given Efficiency V by combining 2 items with Efficiency IV in an anvil . Diamond tools with efficiency V can also be found in end city and bastion remnant chests.
- ↑ Channeling and Loyalty can be used together but neither can be used with Riptide.
The tables below summarize the enchantments that can be obtained on specific items in Bedrock Edition and in Java Edition Survival mode (Any enchantment can be applied to any item in Java Edition Creative mode). Enchantments that can be applied to both hand slot items and armor slot items are listed in both tables.
- An enchanting table indicates the item can receive the enchantment from an enchanting table .
- An anvil indicates the item cannot receive the enchantment from an enchanting table, but can receive the enchantment by using an anvil to combine the item with an enchanted book or another enchanted item.

========================================
PAGE NAME: MOBS
URL: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob
========================================
H1: Mob
A mob (short for mobile , mobile entity , or mobile object ) [ 1 ] is an AI-driven game entity . All mobs can be attacked or hurt (from falling , attacked by a player or another mob, falling into the void , hit by an arrow , etc, with the exception of protected creakings ), and have some form of voluntary movement. Different types of mobs often have unique AI and loot .
H2: Spawning
Mobs spawn in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on the light level , biome , and their surroundings. For example, most animals are found in bright areas on the surface, while hostile monsters are commonly found in the dark (whether it's a cave , monster room , mansion , or at night). Animals usually spawn upon chunk generation, while hostile monsters spawn and despawn in a certain radius around the player.
Some mobs, including passive and neutral animals, and even hoglins , have the ability to be bred by the player , creating offspring. Villagers cannot be directly bred by the player, instead randomly breeding depending on the time of day and the number of beds , which allows players to manipulate their likelihood of breeding.
Most mobs never spawn on transparent blocks, in water (except fish, dolphins, turtles, and other aquatic creatures), in lava (except for striders ), on bedrock , or on blocks less than a full block tall (such as slabs placed on the bottom half). The exception is monster spawners , from which monsters can spawn naturally on any block including air .
Some mobs (like the snow golem and the wither ) require that the player "construct" them before being able to spawn. The iron golem can spawn naturally and can also be constructed. The ender dragon can be respawned with four end crystals . A rare occurrence of spawning are the jockey mobs, which is a mob riding another mob.
Players can also spawn mobs easily by using spawn eggs in Creative mode or the / summon command.
H3: Despawning
Many mobs despawn (cease to exist) after a certain amount of time if far enough from the player. In Java Edition , most passive mobs do not despawn, while most monsters do. In Bedrock Edition , almost all mobs despawn. Mobs can be prevented from despawning if they are named with a name tag , and in Java Edition [ verify ] , also in a boat .
H2: Behavior
Mobs are affected by the environment in the same ways as the player; they are subject to physics , and they can be hurt by the same things that harm the player (catching on fire, falling, drowning, attacks from weapons, the /kill command, etc.). Some mobs may be resistant or immune to certain hazards, such as some Nether mobs, which are immune to fire. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning. Mobs can ride minecarts and other mobs can climb up ladders . When mobs are killed, they turn to smoke particles and drop items that may be useful resources.
Each type of mob in Minecraft has a certain AI (artificial intelligence) system with different behaviors and mechanics. Mobs ordinarily wander around at random if there is a player within 32 blocks and usually avoid walking off blocks high enough to cause falling damage. Many mobs have an advanced path-finding system that allows them to navigate through obstacles to get to a desired object or destination. Passive mobs flee in random directions after being hurt, while hostile mobs face and chase/attack the player as soon as the player comes close. Neutral mobs remain neutral until a player or mob provokes it (usually by attacking), at which point the neutral mob becomes hostile toward and attacks the entity that hit it. Most mobs are aware of players within (a Euclidian distance ) 16 blocks of them, but some can see farther. Conversely, most mobs can be heard by players up to 16 blocks away. Mobs are harmless to players in Creative mode.
Most mobs cannot see through most solid blocks, including semi-transparent blocks such as ice , glass , tall grass , or glass panes . In Java Edition , all mobs (except for wardens [ 2 ] ) try to avoid walking over rails unless pushed onto the rails by other mobs.
Using specific name tags on mobs can result in unusual behavior or rendering. See Name Tag § Easter eggs for details.
H2: List of mobs
Mobs are listed and classified by their nature from the player's perspective. For more details on a particular mob, click on them to view their individual page.
H3: Passive mobs
Passive mobs are harmless mobs (except for pufferfish ) that do not attempt to attack the player, even when provoked or attacked, though some of them may attack other mobs. Most of them can be bred or tamed .

H2: Classification
Most of the mobs are classified into categories, such as the animals or the monsters . Some creatures are then further classified into more specific groups, based on detailed characteristics and properties they share with other members of that group. There are a total of four mob classifications that display unique characteristics from other mobs.
H3: Weaknesses and immunities
Some mobs are weak or immune to certain type of damage. For example, aquatic creatures, such as turtles and guardians , take more damage from tridents that are enchanted with Impaling ‌ [ Java Edition only ] ‌ [ until JE Combat Tests ] . All undead mobs are healed by potions of Harming and take extra damage from weapons enchanted with Smite , along with taking damage from potions of Healing . Many of these weaknesses and immunities are a result of what category (see below) of mobs that mob falls into.
H3: Undead mobs
This group of mobs includes bogged , drowned , old zombie villagers, husks , phantoms , skeletons , skeleton horses , strays , withers , wither skeletons , zoglins , zombies , zombie horses , zombie villagers , and zombified piglins . These mobs are damaged by potions of Healing, healed by potions of Harming, are unaffected by Regeneration and Poison, and are immune to drowning (except for husks and zombies, which transform into zombies and drowned if submerged underwater, respectively). Zombies, zombie villagers, drowned, skeletons, strays, bogged, and phantoms burn when under direct sunlight, unless they are touching water or wearing a helmet. Under the Fire Resistance effect, these undead mobs still catch fire in direct sunlight but are not damaged by it. All undead mobs except for drowned, phantoms, and withers cannot swim and sink when in water. All undead mobs take extra damage from weapons enchanted with Smite , are ignored by withers, and scare armadillos into hiding into their shells.
Many undead mobs can spawn with the ability to pick up items and equipment from the ground. Some can sometimes spawn wearing armor , or holding tools or weapons .
H3: Aquatic mobs
This group of mobs includes axolotls , dolphins , squid , glow squid , guardians , elder guardians , tadpoles , turtles , cod , salmon , pufferfish , and tropical fish , but not drowned. [ 7 ] They take extra damage from tridents enchanted with Impaling ,‌ [ Java Edition only ] ‌ [ until JE Combat Tests ] and, except axolotls, do not cause pufferfish to inflate nor take damage from them. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning, and all except guardians, elder guardians, and turtles take suffocation damage if out of water for too long. Aquatic mobs have the ability to freely swim vertically, whereas other mobs simply float on the surface of the water or sink.
H3: Arthropods
This group consists of mobs based on arthropods , namely bees , cave spiders , endermites , silverfish , and spiders . They take extra damage and receive the Slowness IV effect when attacked with weapons enchanted with Bane of Arthropods .
H3: Illagers
This group includes pillagers , illusioners ‌ [ JE only ] , evokers , and vindicators . They are immune to evoker fangs damage and ignored by vindicators named "Johnny". They are hostile toward adult villagers , wandering traders , iron golems and players in Survival or Adventure mode. Ravagers , witches , and vexes accompany them in raids but are not illagers themselves. Illusioners (and witches‌ [ Bedrock Edition only ] ) can see players or targets through blocks.
H3: Knockback resistance
Some non-boss mobs resist a certain percentage of knockback from attacks.

H2: Trivia
- In Java Edition , the rarest mob is a zombie villager chicken jockey wearing full enchanted diamond armor and holding an enchanted iron sword in its left hand.
- There are many blocks in the game that do not take up a full block, such as trapdoors, and mobs actually see many of these as full blocks. Mobs mistake some blocks for air , such as carpets , snow , and string .
- Mobs mistake some blocks for air , such as carpets , snow , and string .
- Despite the term mob being derived from mobile entity, supplementary material consistently uses it within the Minecraft universe. Characters from Minecraft Story Mode begin calling monsters mobs starting in Order Up , whereas Farnum refers to himself as a “mobologist.”
- In Bedrock Edition , due to the lack of a "living entity" class of entities, armor stands , cameras , and even players are internally represented as "mobs". This has no direct effect on how these entities behave. However, in Java Edition , the advancements and statistics classify them as mobs.
- Mobs mistake some blocks for air , such as carpets , snow , and string .

========================================
PAGE NAME: BLOCKS
URL: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block
========================================
H1: Block
Blocks are the basic units of structure in Minecraft that make up the game's world. Many blocks can be collected and placed anywhere, as well as be used as helpful resources.
H2: Behavior
Blocks are arranged in a 3-dimensional grid of 1-cubic-meter cells, although some blocks appear to occupy a partial cell; these include slabs , snow layers, ladders , vines , stairs , turtle eggs , and sea pickles , among others.
Collectively, blocks and fluids make up the in-game environment, and most can be harvested and utilized in various fashions. Some blocks, such as dirt and sandstone , are opaque and occupy their entire cubic meter, while others, such as glass and flowers , are transparent or non-solid. Explosions destroy some blocks more easily than they destroy others, while some are virtually immune to explosions. They can still be theoreticlly exploded.
Air is a special block that acts as a substitute for the absence of blocks. It has two variants: cave air and void air .‌ [ Java Edition only ]
Some blocks, such as sea lanterns and glowstone , emit light , the amount of which varies widely; see this table of light values for further information. Opaque blocks completely block light, while transparent blocks have no effect on light, block the light, or merely weaken it.
Almost all blocks ignore gravity, except for sand , red sand , gravel , anvils of all damage levels, dragon eggs , all colors of concrete powder , scaffolding , snow layers‌ [ BE only ] , pointed dripstone , suspicious sand , and suspicious gravel . These turn into entities when their support is removed.
When broken, blocks emit sounds and particles associated with themselves, except in the following cases:
- If the block is affected by gravity and falls into an invalid space (If the block is gravity based and drops onto a torch, for example). [ 1 ]
- Anvils that are destroyed by running out of durability or falling. Only particles are missing. [ 2 ]
- If the block can be washed away and is washed away by a flowing fluid. [ 3 ]
- If the block can be replaced by other blocks and is replaced. [ 4 ]
- If the block is one of a few blocks such as rails or redstone wire, supported by another block and its supporting block is removed. [ 5 ]
- If the block is leaves and decays. [ 6 ]
H2: Block height
Most solid blocks are 1 meter high (3.28084... feet or 1250 ⁄ 381 feet), but several blocks have non-standard block heights, such as slabs .
A player can automatically step up from a lower to a higher height if the difference is at most 0.6 ( 3 ⁄ 5 ) of a block or 1.9685... feet ( 250 ⁄ 127 feet).
H2: Textures
The textures on the faces of most blocks are 16×16 pixels. Exceptions include candles , sculk sensors , etc. Most blocks are proportionately one cubic meter by default, but their shape can be changed using models .
Most blocks have static textures, but these blocks are animated : water , lava , Nether portal , end portal , end gateway , prismarine (slab; stairs; wall), sea lantern , magma block , seagrass , kelp , fire , lantern , lit campfire and their soul variants, lit blast furnace , heat block ‌ [ BE & edu only ] , stems , hyphae , lit smoker , stonecutter , sculk , sculk shrieker , sculk sensor , calibrated sculk sensor , sculk vein , and command block .
Players can change their textures by changing their files in-game. The following explains how. In the menu, go to "Options", then select the "Resource Pack" option. Two panels appear: "Available" and "Selected" (the Default resource pack should be under "Selected").
- If there is any resource pack under "Available", drag it into "Selected", then click "Done". The resource pack should be active in a few moments.
- If there is none, click "Open Pack Folder". This redirects you to the game directory. If you have a file or folder containing the resource pack, move it here. Go back to the game, exit the menu, and then enter to the "Resource Pack" option again. Your file should now be there. Drag it as described in the first point above.
Using resource packs , the player can change the textures and resolution of blocks, including whether their texture is animated. They can also change the shapes of blocks using models and the size of blocks to any size with equal width and height, though sizes that are a power of two tend to work better.

H2: Trivia
- Certain blocks may interpret positions they cannot be placed in by normal means as a valid position. For example, a sign placed in midair via / setblock remains in midair even when updated, until either it is broken, or a block is placed below it and broken.

========================================
PAGE NAME: ITEMS
URL: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Item
========================================
H1: Item
An item is an object that can exist within inventories of players , mobs , or armor stands ; in various storage blocks (like chests or droppers ), as well as in item frames and glow item frames .
H2: Behavior
Some items, when used , place a block (ItemBlock) or entity (minecart, spawn eggs, etc.) version of themselves into the game world. Put simply, they are an item when in the inventory , and a block when placed. For example, boats turn into an entity when placed, and beds turn into a group of blocks when placed. When selected in the hotbar , items briefly display their names above the HUD .
The only method by which an item can be properly displayed within the game environment is to place it into an item frame .
H3: Thrown items
If an item that does not become a block is dropped, it becomes an entity represented by a sprite that floats above the ground. It remains for 5 minutes in a loaded chunk before despawning (except for the nether star ), unless the player walks over it to pick it up, it is picked up by a mob, hopper or minecart with hopper , or it is destroyed by fire , lava , cactus , explosion , void , or / kill .
A submerged object ascends toward the water's surface. If the water is flowing, the object is pushed along with it.
Hoppers draw in any items that are placed above them if they are not powered by redstone.

TABLE:
Thrown item properties
Drag-H | 0.99 | Gravity | -0.04m/tick2
Drag-Y | 0.98
Ticking order | 3
Launch angle calculator[note 1]
Given a target coordinate and an initial speed, calculate the thrown item launch angle to hit the target.Target is hit afterticks.
X | 0–1 | Yaw | deg
Y | 0–1 | Pitch | degUnreachable
Z | 0–1 | Speed | 0.6m/tick

0.98
deg Unreachable
- ↑ Yaw and pitch follow the Minecraft' s convention , thus zero yaw is directed at +Z (south) and looking upwards corresponds to negative values of pitch.
H3: Stacking
Items can either stack up to 64 or 16, or not stack at all:
- Most items can stack to 64. This includes all blocks .
- Some items, such as snowballs , empty buckets , eggs , signs and ender pearls , can stack up to a maximum of 16.
- Some other items do not stack at all, such as anything with a durability ( weapons , armor , and tools ), filled buckets , and potions .
- All items can technically be forced to stack up to 99‌ [ JE only ] or 127‌ [ BE only ] using commands .

PAGE NAME: CRAFTING INFORMATION
URL: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Crafting
========================================
H1: Crafting
Crafting is the process of constructing tools , items , and blocks in Minecraft that can be performed via the inventory , a crafting table , or automatically using a crafter .
H2: Crafting system
H3: Manual crafting
Players in Survival and Adventure mode, as well as Creative in Bedrock Edition and Spectator in Java Edition , have access to a 2×2 crafting grid from their inventory screen. Players craft by arranging items in the crafting grid to match a given recipe. Small crafting recipes that are at most 2×2 can be made there, including wooden planks , sticks , crafting tables , and torches .
To craft more complex items, a crafting table must be created, placed, and used . This brings up an interface with a larger 3×3 crafting grid in which the player can use to craft any crafting recipe in the game. Recipes fitting the 2×2 grid can also be crafted in the crafting table's 3×3 grid. There is a recipe book button in the inventory where the player can access all of their unlocked crafting recipes.
Some recipes don't require their ingredients to be arranged in a specific way on the crafting grid. These are commonly known as "shapeless" recipes. For example, players may craft a fermented spider eye by placing its ingredients anywhere within the grid.
Most recipes must have their ingredients placed in the correct relative positions on the crafting grid. These are commonly known as "shaped " recipes. Ingredients in shaped recipes can be moved up, down, left, or right. They can also be flipped side-ways. For example, a 3×1 recipe, such as bread , can be made using the top, middle, or bottom row of the 3×3 grid, and a bow may be made with the strings placed on the left instead of on the right.
There are recipes that may not be moved or mirrored in this way. These are commonly known as "fixed" recipes. For example, dyes in banner recipes - only available in Bedrock Edition - must be specifically placed to achieve the desired pattern. No fixed recipes exist in Java Edition , but they can be added by data packs , add-ons , or mods .
Unlike other in-game actions such as smelting , brewing , and enchanting , crafting is completely silent.
H3: Automated crafting
Crafting can be automated using the crafter .
The simplest way to do this is for the player to add the items for the crafting into the crafter manually, however this process can itself be automated using hoppers . In order to control which slots the hopper puts the item into it is possible to disable certain slots to prevent the input of items. When items are put into a crafter automatically they fill every enabled slot equally from left to right and top to bottom, in that order. If all slots are disabled, then hoppers connected to it cannot put items in it.
The crafter can craft anything that a normal crafting table can.
Crafters require a redstone signal to activate.
Automated crafting is useful in both storage systems and automated farms , as it provides a way to automatically craft items and blocks that once required manual input.
H3: Recipe book
The recipe book is a mechanic that serves as a catalog of recipes and as a crafting guide. It shows every crafting recipe that the player has unlocked.
Crafting recipes are organized in several different categories. The categories differ between Java and Bedrock .
In Bedrock Edition , categories consist of craftable items from each Creative inventory tab.
In Java Edition , the categories are as follows:
- The first tab contains every unlocked recipe.
- The second tab contains utility items, tools , weapons , and armor .
- The third tab contains building materials.
- The fourth tab contains food , ingredients, and miscellaneous items.
- The fifth tab contains redstone materials.
H3: Recipe system
Recipes, including crafting recipes, can be configured by data packs in Java Edition or add-ons in Bedrock Edition .

PAGE NAME: SMELTING
URL: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Smelting
========================================
H1: Smelting
Smelting is the process of obtaining refined goods from raw materials by heating them in a furnace or blast furnace . When items are smelted in either type of furnace, experience is dropped. Like crafting , smelting uses recipes to determine what item is produced. Smelting is one of the two functions of a furnace (the second being cooking food ) and the sole function of a blast furnace .
H2: Methods
H3: Furnace
The furnace interface contains three item slots: the upper left slot for the item that needs to be smelted, the lower left slot for fuel, and the right slot where output items accumulate and can be retrieved by the player. Flames above the fuel slot act as a gauge showing the amount of fuel left of the current fuel item. An arrow in the middle shows the progress of smelting the current item.
The furnace takes 10 seconds (200 in-game ticks) to smelt an item. It begins to smelt if both input item and fuel are placed into the corresponding slots, and there is space in the output slot.
When starting, a fuel item is consumed immediately, filling the fuel gauge. Different fuels will fuel the furnace for different amounts of time. The fuel gauge indicates how much of that fuel's burn time remains, and gradually decreases even if the input slot becomes empty. When a fuel item is fully consumed and the input slot is not empty, another one is taken from the fuel slot, and the gauge resets.
The furnace processes one input item at a time, which remains in the input slot during the 10-second process. So if multiple types of items or more than one stack of item need to be smelted, the player need to move in the item manually or using hoppers.
The arrow indicates the progress on how much the input has been smelted and how much more it needs to be smelted. When the arrow is full, the input item is removed from the input stack and an output item is added to the output stack. Smelting of the next input item then begins immediately.
Furnaces stop smelting under any of four conditions:
- When the furnace runs out of smeltable items: The input slot becomes empty or contains item that cannot be smelted.
- The furnace runs out of fuel: The fuel input slot is empty, and the current fuel item is fully consumed (that is, the fuel gauge becomes empty).
- The output slot becomes full: Either the slot has a full stack of the output, or the output contains the wrong output item for the current input item (for example, if the output contains iron ingots , but the input contains raw beef ). In this case, smelting (but not fuel consumption) is paused until the output slot becomes available (usually because items were removed by either a player or a hopper). If a fuel item burns out in this condition, a new one is not used until the output slot is again available.
- The furnace is broken: The contents of all the slots, any accumulated experience, and the furnace itself are dropped. The currently-burning fuel item is lost since it is removed from the fuel slot before burning begins. The furnace block itself may not be dropped if it was destroyed by an explosion.
If smelting stops while a fuel item is still burning, the furnace continues to run visually, but no more input items are processed. If the fuel has been exhausted when an item has been partly smelted, the smelting progress is undone at double speed, and the item remains in the input stack.
Smelting is suspended if the chunk the furnace is in becomes unloaded. It resumes when the chunk is loaded again.
H3: Blast furnace and smoker
Smokers and blast furnaces use the same GUI interface as regular furnaces and function similarly to regular furnaces. They smelt twice as quickly as furnaces, requiring only 5 seconds (100 game ticks) to smelt 1 item; they consume the same amount of fuel as regular furnaces per item smelted. Blast furnaces can only smelt ores, while smokers can only cook food; any other item can be smelted only in regular furnaces.
H2: Recipes
All smelting recipes can be used in the furnace, but only subsets are available in the blast furnace and smoker.
The furnace, blast furnace and smoker keep track of experience for each item as smelting is completed for them, accumulating it in a hidden counter. The counter remembers the total earned experience even if a hopper is used to remove the items from the output slot. Experience is awarded to the player who uses the interface to remove items manually, after which the counter is reset. If the player takes some of the output but leaves some in the slot, the experience corresponding to items left in the furnace is retained and not awarded to the player. For fractional experience values, first multiply this value by the number of smelted items removed from the furnace, then award the player the integer part, and if there is a fractional part remaining, this represents the chance of an additional experience point.
- For example, when smelting 1 coal ore and removing the coal, the value is 0.1, so every ten coal removed grants one experience point on average.
- When smelting 6 sea pickles and removing all 6 lime dye , the value is 0.2×6 = 1.2, so this grants 1 point, plus a 20% chance of another 1 point.
- The fractional experience stays within the furnace when the final total is not an integer, so the leftover experience is attributed to the next round of smelting.
H3: Food
All food recipes can be used in a furnace or smoker. Food can alternatively be cooked on a campfire.

The following additional ores can be smelted, but it's more efficient to mine them with an appropriate pickaxe. In most cases mining them saves fuel and yields more product and experience, especially if the pickaxe has a Fortune enchantment. Smelting them, though, allows obtaining them from an automatic device. The ore blocks themselves can be obtained only with the Silk Touch enchantment.

A single lava bucket or a block of coal can smelt more items than can fit in the furnace, a lava bucket being able to smelt 100 blocks and a block of coal being able to smelt 80 —both input and output are limited to a maximum of a stack of 64 items (with some items not being able to be stacked or being possible to stack only 16 of them).
This is the specific table for all the fuels:

- ↑ All times given are for fuel burned in a furnace . When burned in a blast furnace or smoker , fuel is burned twice as fast but produces the same number of items.
- ↑ Items in red are not stackable, items in yellow only stack up to 16.
- ↑ Calculated as the burning time in seconds divided by the number of logs used to make one fuel when all wood ingredients are made from logs. Items in red are not made entirely of wood.
- ↑ Calculated as the burning time in seconds divided by the amount of bamboo used to make one fuel when all wood ingredient are made from bamboo. Items in red are not made entirely of bamboo.
- ↑ Requires 9 smelting operations to obtain, so net output is 11 operations.
- ↑ 80 seconds of fuel per log, but 10 seconds are needed to smelt the charcoal, so the net time is 70 seconds.
- ↑ a b c d e f Wooden slabs have the same burn time as planks due to a bug; see MCPE-94368 .
H2: Hopper automation
The smelting process can be automated with hoppers on the top and bottom of the furnace. For larger smelting jobs, a third hopper on the side of the furnace can feed in fuel and, in case of lava being used as fuel, any empty buckets come out of the bottom hopper. This automatically feeds and empties the furnace so that different materials can be smelted in the same batch with no loss.
Whenever a hopper or minecart with hopper removes items from a furnace, any experience earned from cooking or smelting the removed items is saved in the furnace and awarded to the next player who either breaks the furnace or manually removes an item from the furnace's output slot. This saved experience is in addition to that earned for the manually removed item(s).

H2: Trivia
- A wooden tool burns the same regardless of its remaining durability. A used-up tool is just as effective as fuel as a new tool.
- "Smelting" is a broad term in the context of Minecraft while in the real world, smelting has a more precise definition. [ 8 ]

PAGE NAME: REDSTONE
URL: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Redstone_circuits
========================================
H1: Redstone circuits
A redstone circuit is a build that is primarily focused on dealing with logic and redstone signals. Circuits can be used to transmit redstone signals, perform operations with logic gates , store data, shorten or lengthen redstone signals, make clocks, and more.
A useful distinction can be made between a circuit performing operations on signals (generating, modifying, combining, etc.), and a mechanism using the environment (moving blocks, opening doors, changing the light level, producing sound, etc). Making this distinction allows us to talk about the various circuits separately, and let all players choose whichever circuits are useful for their purposes. The machines controlled by redstone circuits can range from simple devices such as automatic doors and light switches to complex devices such as elevators, automatic farms, or even in-game computers. However, this article provides only an overview of redstone circuits as above. These can be used to control simple mechanisms, or combined as parts of a larger build. Each circuit type on this page has links to its own page, which provides greater detail about them and give schematics for multiple variations of each.
Before working with any but the most basic redstone circuits, an understanding of some basic concepts is required: "power", "signal strength", "redstone ticks", and "block updates". Some relevant articles are listed below:
- The Redstone mechanics article provides more information on these concepts.
- The Redstone components article adds a list and description of all blocks that interact with redstone power in general.
- The Mechanisms tutorial complements this article with an assortment of mechanism designs using circuits described here.
- The Redstone tips tutorial gives general advice about building redstone menchanisms
H2: Describing circuits
Most circuits are described using Schematic diagrams; some of these require multiple images to show one or two layers per image. See the Help:Schematic page for details on how various blocks and components are represented.
H3: Size
The wiki describes circuit size (the volume of the rectangular solid it occupies) with the notation of depth × width × height , including support/floor blocks, but not including inputs/outputs.
Another method used for describing circuit size in the Minecraft community is to ignore non-redstone blocks simply used for support (for example, blocks under redstone dust or repeaters). However, this method is unable to distinguish between flat and 1-high circuits, as well as some other circuit differences.
Sometimes it is convenient to compare circuits simply by the area of their footprint (e.g., 3×4 for a circuit three-block wide by four blocks long), or by a single dimension important in a particular context (e.g., length in a sequence of sub-circuits, height in a confined space, etc.).
H3: Features
Several features may be considered desirable design goals:
Other design goals may include reducing the delay a sub-circuit adds to a larger circuit, reducing the use of resource-expensive components (redstone, nether quartz, etc.), and re-arranging or redesigning a circuit to make it as small as possible.
Some components are not available before a player has access to the Nether, which limits the designs available. In particular, redstone comparators , observers and daylight detectors require nether quartz , which is available only from the Nether. Additionally, redstone lamps require glowstone , which is occasionally available from trading or witches , but is much more plentiful in the Nether.
H2: Circuit types
Although the number of ways to construct circuits is endless, certain patterns of construction occur repeatedly. The following sections attempt to categorize the circuits that have proven useful to the Minecraft community, while the main articles describe the specific circuits that fall into those categories.
Some of these circuits might be used by themselves for simple control of mechanisms, but frequently the player needs to combine them into more complex circuits to meet the needs of a mechanism.
H3: Transmission circuit
Some aspects of signal transmission can be helpful to understand: transmission types, vertical transmission, repeaters, and diodes.

TABLE:
...

H3: Logic circuit
A logic gate is a circuit that takes one or more inputs and produces a single output when some condition has been met. The strength of the input signal in these circuits usually doesn't matter. When an input or output supplies a redstone signal, it is usually just referred to as "on", and when there is no signal, it is referred to as "off". For example, an AND gate takes two redstone signals as input, and outputs a redstone signal only if both inputs are greater than 0. That is, an AND gate is on only when both inputs are on.
In electronic or programming diagrams, logic gates are typically shown as if they were individual devices; However, when building redstone devices in Minecraft , all logic gates are formed from multiple blocks and components, which interact to produce the desired results.

TABLE:
A | On | On | Off | Off | Question Answered
B | On | Off | On | Off
A AND B | ON | Off | Off | Off | Are A and B on?
NOT(A IMPLIES B) | Off | ON | Off | Off | Is A on and B off?
NOT(B IMPLIES A) | Off | Off | ON | Off | Is B on and A off?
A NOR B | Off | Off | Off | ON | Are both inputs off?
A | ON | ON | Off | Off | Is A on?
A XOR B | Off | ON | ON | Off | Are the inputs different?
NOT A | Off | Off | ON | ON | Is A off?
A XNOR B | ON | Off | Off | ON | Are the inputs the same?
B | ON | Off | ON | Off | Is B on?
NOT B | Off | ON | Off | ON | Is B off?
A NAND B | Off | ON | ON | ON | Is either input off?
A IMPLIES B | ON | Off | ON | ON | If A is on, is B also on?
B IMPLIES A | ON | ON | Off | ON | If B is on, is A also on?
A OR B | ON | ON | ON | Off | Is either input on?

H3: Pulse circuit
A pulse circuit produces a redstone signal for a specified amount of time, changes the duration of an input signal, or reacts to signals of a particular duration. Other circuits or mechanisms may require pulses of a particular duration to operate properly, or can use pulse duration to convey information.
A circuit that is stable in one output state and unstable in the other is known as a monostable circuit . [ note 1 ] Many pulse circuits are monostable because their OFF state is stable, but their ON state soon reverts to OFF.
H3: Clock circuit
A clock circuit is a pulse generator that produces a loop of specific pulses repeatedly. Some are designed to run forever, while others can be stopped and started.
A simple clock with only two states of equal duration is named for the duration of its ON state (e.g., for example, a clock that alternates between a 5-tick ON state and a 5-tick OFF state is called a 5-clock) while others are usually named for their period (the time it takes for the clock to return to its original state; for example, a "1-minute clock" might produce a 1-tick pulse every 60 seconds).
H3: Memory circuit
Memory circuits maintain their output until they receive a signal that tells them to change their output. In simple terms, memory circuits stay on or off until they receive a signal telling them to turn off or on. This means that a memory circuit's state (output) depends on the current input and the previous inputs. Most other circuits just temporarily generate an output based on the current input.
Most memory circuits are called "latches" or "flip-flops"; these are named after real-life electronic circuits because they behave similarly. Some basic types of memory circuits are outlined below. See here for an explanation of technical terms.
Memory circuits are named based on the kinds of input they take and any logic gates they use.
Many other memory circuits are possible.
H3: Piston circuits
Pistons allow players to design circuits that are smaller and/or faster than the standard, redstone-only counterparts. An understanding of standard redstone circuits is helpful, as this tutorial is focused on the circuit design rather than the function. The main components here are sticky pistons , regular pistons, redstone wire , repeaters and redstone torches .
There are several benefits of piston circuitry:
- Neither repeaters nor pistons 'burn out', unlike redstone torches.
- Piston circuits are often (not always) smaller and/or faster than their redstone counterparts. This allows building devices such as fast clocks and "instant" signal transmission.
- Pistons' ability to move blocks within the world makes them a natural for memory circuits, as well as the obvious doorways and switchable bridges. With slime or honey blocks involved, entire structures can "get up and move" (see also tutorial on flying machines ).
- Piston circuits can sharply reduce the use of redstone in favor of wood, stone, and iron.
H3: Miscellaneous circuits
These circuits aren't generally needed for redstone projects, but might find use in complex projects, proofs of concept, and thought experiments. Some examples:
